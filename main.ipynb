He claims: (1) he was denied his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to the assistance of counsel because trial counsel did not present sufficient evidence to support a voluntary intoxication defense and appellate counsel failed to adequately argue trial counsel’s ineffectiveness in that regard (grounds one and two); and (2) he was denied his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process when the State of Oklahoma prosecuted him for major crimes he committed in Indian country because he is an Indian (ground three). Dkts. 1, 6. Respondent opposes the petition. Dkt. 14. Having considered the petition and supporting brief (Dkts. 1, 6), the response (Dkt. 14), Respondent’s supplemental brief (Dkt. 19), the state court record (Dkts. 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 14-1 through 14-15, 15-1 through 15-40, and 16), and applicable law, the Court finds and concludes that the petition shall be denied. 1 July is incarcerated at the Dick Conner Correctional Center, and Scott Tinsley is the interim warden of that facility. The Court therefore substitutes Scott Tinsley, Interim Warden, in place of Janet Dowling as party respondent. Fed. R. Civ.

Factual background In November 2013, Michelle Ashlock had been dating July since April 2013. Dkt. 15-10 at 97-98.2 On November 9th, Ashlock visited Joseph and Stephanie Green at the Greens’ Tulsa apartment. Id. at 108; Dkt. 15-9 at 54-56, 116-18. July arrived at the apartment around 10:30 p.m., driving a green car. Dkt. 15-9 at 56-57, 60; Dkt. 15-10 at 111. With him were Quinton Shaver and Christine Farar-Brown, both of whom had been with July at a house on Trenton Avenue in Tulsa, waiting for July to help Shaver cash a stolen check and helping July get some methamphetamine. Dkt. 15-11 at 26-33. July went inside the Greens’ apartment while Shaver and Farar-Brown stayed in the car. Id. at 33-34. The Greens, July, and Ashlock sat in the Greens’ bedroom talking and getting high. Dkt. 15-9 at 56-57, 133-36; Dkt. 15-10 at 109-10. The Greens and Ashlock used heroin, methamphetamine, or a mixture of these two drugs at the apartment; July used methamphetamine, or a mixture of methamphetamine and heroin before he arrived at the apartment. Dkt. 15-9 at 57, 87-90, 133; Dkt. 15-10 at 109-10, 162.3 At some point, Ashlock left the apartment and drove her white car to a nearby QuikTrip to get cigarettes. Dkt. 15-10 at 112. When July realized Ashlock was gone, he asked Joseph if Ashlock had stolen anything from the 2 Unless otherwise noted, the Court’s citations refer to the CM/ECF pagination. 3 Joseph Green testified he ingested a mixture of heroin and methamphetamine, that July “never touched the heroin,” and that he and July “usually” ingest methamphetamine together, but he was not sure if July did so that night at the Greens’ apartment. Dkt. 15-9 at 87-90. Stephanie Green testified that she ingested heroin either earlier in the day or in the evening when she was talking with Ashlock, and that Ashlock ingested methamphetamine. Id. at 133. Ashlock testified that the Greens “got high on heroin,” that she asked to use heroin, and that she ultimately did not use heroin. Dkt. 15-10 at 109-10, 162. Ashlock also testified she used methamphetamine with July sometime before noon and before she went to the Greens’ apartment. Id. at 164. Farar-Brown testified that July injected a “shot” of what she believed was “meth and heroin” while she, Shaver, and July were at the Trenton Avenue house before the trio drove to the Greens’ apartment. Dkt. 15-11 at 30-32, 76-77. apartment and said he was going to find her. Dkt. 15-9 at 59. According to Farar-Brown, July returned to the green car with a gun, screaming “where did the bitch go?” Dkt. 15-11 at 34-35. July drove to QuikTrip and abruptly parked in front of Ashlock’s car, nearly striking it. Id. at 35- 36; Dkt. 15-10 at 113. July got out of the green car, began screaming at Ashlock, opened her car door, and began hitting her in the head with a gun. Dkt. 15-9 at 36; Dkt. 15-10 at 113-14. July pushed Ashlock into the passenger seat of the white car, sat down in the driver’s seat, and drove back to the Greens’ apartment. Dkt. 15-10 at 114-15. Farar-Brown and Shaver followed July to the apartment in the green car. Id. At some point, July called Joseph, stated he had found Ashlock, and further stated that he “was going to teach her a lesson.” Dkt. 15-9 at 61. July parked Ashlock’s white car in the Greens’ driveway, slashed the tires of her car, forced Ashlock into the green car, and continued hitting her with a gun. Dkt. 15-10 at 115-18. July directed Farar-Brown to drive the green car to the Trenton Avenue house. Id. at 118; Dkt. 15-11 at 38. When the foursome arrived at the Trenton Avenue house, July forced Ashlock into the house at gunpoint and dragged her down the hallway by her hair into a back bedroom where he repeatedly hit her with the gun and kicked her. Dkt. 15-10 at 119-22; Dkt. 15-11 at 38-39. Shaver and Farar-Brown sat in the living room, and Farar-Brown could hear July hitting Ashlock. Dkt. 15-11 at 40-42. At some point, July pounded on the door of another bedroom to wake Angel Proctor. Id. at 42. He told Proctor he had “some toys for her to play with.” Id.; Dkt. 15-10 at 120. Proctor then joined July in beating Ashlock and cutting or poking her with a knife; July also hit Ashlock with a liquor bottle until the bottle broke. Dkt. 15-10 at 122-26. July directed Proctor to escort Shaver and Farar-Brown to the back bedroom, and she complied, leading the couple to the back bedroom at gunpoint. Id. at 126-28; Dkt. 15-11 at 43. When Shaver and Farar-Brown urged July and Proctor to stop beating Ashlock, July accused Farar-Brown of being a snitch and struck Farar-Brown in the eye with a gun or a fist. Dkt. 15-10 at 129-30; Dkt. 15-11 at 44-46. July also struck Shaver in the face with a gun or a fist. Dkt. 15-10 at 129; Dkt. 15-11 at 47. While Ashlock and Farar-Brown sat in the corner of the room, they watched as July and Proctor continued to hit Shaver, stomp on his head, and beat him with a mop handle and a chair leg. Dkt. 15-10 at 130-36; Dkt. 15-11 at 47-54. Eventually, July strangled Shaver with a pair of jeans. Dkt. 15-10 at 131-32; Dkt. 15-11, at 207-09. Throughout this time, July and Proctor were drinking whiskey, laughing, kissing, and taking turns kicking Ashlock and Farar-Brown in the head. Dkt. 15-10 at 122-30; Dkt. 15-11 at 44-54. July would leave the back bedroom periodically because he appeared concerned that someone was outside, July threatened to kill “all witnesses,” the families of witnesses, and the police. Dkt. 15-10 at 134; Dkt. 15-11 at 55-59. At some point, July and Proctor shared a marijuana joint. Dkt. 15-10 at 135. July also staggered around the room and passed out more than once. Id. at 137-40. When he woke from briefly passing out, he accused Proctor of releasing “the other three hostages” and Proctor assured him that everyone was still in the bedroom. Id. at 139. July also appeared to be hallucinating, and Proctor asked Ashlock if July often sees people that are not there. Id. at 140. Ashlock replied she previously had seen July talk to his dead parents. Id. at 141. At some point, July passed out next to Shaver, the latter of whom was bleeding profusely and barely breathing. Dkt. 15-10 at 140; Dkt. 15-11 at 59. When Proctor could not rouse July, she became frantic. Dkt. 15-10 at 140; Dkt. 15-11 at 60. Ashlock told Proctor that July would kill everyone if they were there when July woke up. Dkt. 15-10 at 141-42. Proctor then escorted Ashlock and Farar-Brown to the green car, at gunpoint, and directed Ashlock to drive to Tahlequah. Dkt. 15-10 at 142-44; Dkt. 15-11 at 60-64. According to Ashlock, Proctor had three guns in her lap and, “started tripping and getting all weirded out,” and stated she felt “funny.” Dkt. 15-10 at 146. Ashlock saw Proctor “pull[] out what [July] handed to her, which was a needle, with whatever in it and [Proctor] started freaking out.” Id. When the trio reached Tahlequah, they went to the home of Proctor’s friend where Proctor searched through duffel bags she had taken from the Trenton Avenue house, looking for items that she could sell, and went outside to burn “some phones and stuff.” Dkt. 15-10 at 147-50; Dkt. 15-11 at 60-64; Dkt. 15-37 at 22. On the morning of November 10th, July called Joseph and asked him to drive to the Trenton Avenue house. Dkt. 15-9 at 61-62. When Joseph arrived, July told him not to touch anything, led him to the back bedroom, and showed him Shaver’s body.4 Id. at 63-64. Joseph asked July if Shaver was dead, and July said, “yes.” Id. at 78. When Joseph asked July if he shot Shaver, July said, “no, he was beat to death.” Id. at 148. July also told Joseph he “fucked up,” that “things kind of got out of control,” that there had been some beatings, and that he had passed out after taking a Xanax. Id. at 65, 79, 94, 109-11. July told Joseph he did not know what happened to Ashlock and Farar-Brown, but he feared Proctor had taken them away. Id. at 65-67, 111-12, 140-41. July gathered up his belongings, and Joseph drove July back to the Greens’ apartment. Id. at 65-67. Joseph and Stephanie later returned to the Trenton Avenue house with July, and Stephanie saw Shaver’s body in the back bedroom. Id. at 67-70, 97, 121-23. Later that afternoon, and unbeknownst to July, the Greens called a law enforcement officer to report that they had seen Shaver’s body at the Trenton Avenue house. Dkt. 15-9 at 73-76, 125- 29, 146-49. A team of law enforcement officers surveilled the Greens’ apartment, the Trenton Avenue house, and a nearby McDonald’s where July’s white truck was parked. Id. at 150-52. At the Greens’ apartment, officers watched July load items into a dark-colored truck, followed the 4 Shaver was declared dead around 8:00 p.m. on November 10th and the medical examiner who performed his autopsy determined that he died from a combination of multiple blunt impact injuries and asphyxia due to strangulation. Dkt. 15-11 at 227-28. truck after it left the apartment, and arrested July after a brief vehicle pursuit and foot chase. Id. at 152-57, 165, 199-214, 217-29. In a search incident to July’s arrest, officers recovered several items from July’s person, including a handgun and methamphetamine, and found inside his wallet a handwritten list of cleaning supplies and identification cards belonging to Proctor and Shaver. Id. at 217-29; Dkt. 15-24 at 1-6; Dkt. 15-10 at 42-46, 216-18; Dkt. 15-33 at 2. After they learned of July’s arrest, Ashlock and Farar-Brown drove the green car back to Tulsa, without Proctor, and the two were interviewed the next day by law enforcement officers. Dkt. 15-10 at 152-57. During a post-arrest interview, July initially denied knowing Proctor, Ashlock, Shaver, and Farar-Brown; having ever been to the Trenton Avenue house; being in the truck that was followed and pursued by law enforcement officers; having a gun on him when he was arrested; and committing any crimes. Dkt. 15-11 at 165-75.5 Eventually, July offered detectives “multiple stories with different individuals involved in each story”; admitted he had been dating Ashlock, he knew Proctor, and he had been at the Trenton Avenue house “drinking and drugging”; and maintained that he was not involved in beating anyone or in killing Shaver. Id. at 165-75, 185-86. Forensic analysis revealed an exceedingly high probability that Shaver’s blood and DNA were found on the shoes and sweatshirt July was wearing when he was arrested. Dkt. 15-10 at 239-40, 246, 278-89. II. Procedural background Following a trial, a jury found July guilty of murder in the first degree; three counts of kidnapping; two counts of assault and battery with a deadly weapon; possession of a firearm after former conviction of a felony; and possession of a controlled dangerous substance. Dkt. 1-3 at 1. 5 July’s videotaped interview was not admitted at trial, but one of the interviewing detectives testified about statements he made during the interview. Dkt. 15-11 at 165-75, 247-48 The jury recommended life without the possibility of parole on the murder count and life imprisonment on all other counts. Id. The trial court sentenced July accordingly and ordered all counts to be served consecutively. Id. July appealed to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (“OCCA”), raising six claims. Dkt. 14-1. Relevant to this proceeding, July claimed trial counsel provided constitutionally deficient representation by failing to present sufficient evidence to support a voluntary intoxication defense. Dkt. 14-1, at 19-20. He requested an evidentiary hearing to develop this claim. Dkt. 14- 2. The OCCA denied July’s request for an evidentiary hearing, denied relief as to all claims, and affirmed his convictions and sentences. Dkt. 1-3 at 22. July did not seek further direct review by filing a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court (“Supreme Court”). Dkt. 1 at 3. July’s state criminal judgment became final in 2016. Dkt. 1-1 at 6. July applied for postconviction relief, asserting two claims.6 Dkt. 14-5. First, July claimed that the State lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him because he is an enrolled member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation with some degree of Creek blood, and crimes he committed within the Cherokee Nation Reservation are subject to federal criminal jurisdiction under the Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1153 (“MCA”). Id. at 11-20. Second, July claimed appellate counsel provided constitutionally deficient representation by failing to “proffer any evidence to support” the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim July raised on direct appeal. Id. at 21-28. The state district court denied relief as to both claims, July appealed, and the OCCA affirmed the denial of postconviction relief. Dkts. 14-11 through 14-14. July now seeks federal habeas relief, and Respondent urges the Court to deny the petition. Dkts. 1, 6, 14. 6 July’s state postconviction counsel represents July in this proceeding. DISCUSSION I. Legal standards A federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner if the prisoner shows that he “is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a). But the “prisoner must exhaust available state remedies before presenting his claim to a federal habeas court.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A); Davila v. Davis, 582 U.S. 521, 527 (2017).7 And the way the state court resolves the federal claim determines the scope of federal habeas review. If the state court denies the federal claim after a merits adjudication, the prisoner must make a threshold showing that the state court’s adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that either (1) is “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), or (2) is “based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,” id. § 2254(d)(2). The prisoner “carries the burden of proof” in satisfying these standards. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 181 (2001). When a claim is subject to review under § 2254(d)(1), a federal court must determine (1) whether clearly established federal law—i.e., “something akin to [an] on-point holding[]” by the Supreme Court, exists and, if so, (2) whether the prisoner has shown that the state court either (a) decided the federal claim in a manner that is contrary to the Supreme Court’s holding or (b) applied that law to the facts of the case in an objectively unreasonable manner. House v. Hatch, 527 F.3d 1010, 1015-19 (10th Cir. 2008). A state court decision is objectively unreasonable only if it “is so 7 A state prisoner generally must file a federal habeas petition within one year of the date his or her criminal judgment became final, but the limitation period is tolled while a properly filed application for state postconviction or other collateral review is pending in state court. 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1), (d)(2). Respondent concedes that July exhausted available state remedies and timely filed the petition. Dkt. 14 at 3. obviously wrong that its error lies ‘beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.’” Shinn v. Kayer, 592 U.S. 111, 118 (2020) (quoting Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 103 (2011)). Under § 2254(d)(2), a prisoner must show that the state court’s determination of the facts relevant to the federal claim is objectively unreasonable. House, 527 F.3d at 1015, 1019. But “[t]he standard for determining whether the state court’s decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts ‘is a restrictive one.’” Frederick v. Quick, 79 F.4th 1090, 1104 (10th Cir. 2023) (quoting Grant v. Trammell, 727 F.3d 1006, 1024 (10th Cir. 2013)), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 2634 (2024). A federal court “must defer to the state court’s factual determinations so long as ‘reasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the finding in question.” Smith v. Duckworth, 824 F.3d 1233, 1241 (10th Cir. 2016) (quoting Brumfield v. Cain, 576 U.S. 305, 314 (2015)). If the state court denies the federal claim based on an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the prisoner has procedurally defaulted that claim for purposes of federal habeas review. Davila, 582 U.S. at 527; Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 732 (1991), modified on other grounds by Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1 (2012). A federal court may not review, much less grant relief on, a procedurally defaulted claim unless the prisoner first shows either cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice from the alleged constitutional error or that the federal court’s failure to review the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. Davila, 582 U.S. at 527; Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750; see also McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 392-93 (2013) (discussing miscarriage of justice exception); Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986) (discussing cause and prejudice). Even if a prisoner either satisfies § 2254(d)’s preconditions to relief or makes the showings necessary to overcome the procedural default of a federal claim, the prisoner is not entitled to federal habeas relief. See Brown v. Davenport, 596 U.S. 118, 134 (2022) (“While AEDPA announced certain new conditions to relief, it did not guarantee relief upon their satisfaction.”). Rather, the federal court must review the claim de novo and, if the court finds a constitutional error, “must assess [its] prejudicial impact . . . under the ‘substantial and injurious effect’ standard set forth in Brecht [v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619 (1993)].” Fry v. Pliler, 551 U.S. 112, 121-22 (2007); see Fontenot v. Crow, 4 F.4th 982, 1060-61 (10th Cir. 2021) (noting that federal courts apply de novo review when federal claims, including procedurally defaulted claims, “were not decided on the merits” in state court and that under de novo review “state-court factfinding still receives the benefit of the doubt under § 2254(e)(1)”). Under the Brecht standard, a federal court will grant habeas relief only if the court “is in grave doubt as to the harmlessness of an error that affects substantial rights.” O’Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 445 (1995). Ultimately, to obtain federal habeas relief, the prisoner “must . . . persuade a federal habeas court that ‘law and justice require’ relief.” Davenport, 596 U.S. at 134 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2243). II. Ineffective assistance of counsel (grounds one and two) July claims he received constitutionally deficient legal representation at the trial and appellate levels. Dkt. 1 at 5, 7; Dkt. 6 at 15-24. He contends trial counsel was ineffective for failing “to call an expert witness on methamphetamine intoxication or psychosis, exacerbated by alcohol use.” Id. at 17-24. July acknowledges that appellate counsel raised this claim on direct appeal, but he contends appellate counsel was ineffective for failing adequately present this claim and proffer evidence to support it. Id. A. Clearly established federal law The Sixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall . . . have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” U.S. Const. Amend. 6. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Sixth Amendment, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, as providing a criminal defendant with the right to the effective assistance of counsel. See McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 n.14 (1970) (“It has long been recognized that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.”); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 341-44 (1963) (reaffirming that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause). Typically, a defendant alleging constitutionally deficient representation must show: (1) “that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness”; and (2) “that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688, 694 (1984). “A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id. at 694. In framing this as a two-part inquiry, the Strickland Court did “not establish mechanical rules.” Id. at 696. Rather, the Strickland Court emphasized that while the two-part inquiry “should guide” courts adjudicating ineffective assistance of counsel claims, “the ultimate focus of inquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged.” Id. The Strickland Court also recognized that courts may adjudicate these claims without addressing both components of the two-part inquiry, stating, there is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the inquiry in the same order or even to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one. In particular, a court need not determine whether counsel’s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies. The object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel’s performance. If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed. Id. at 697. Strickland’s analytical framework also informs a court’s adjudication of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims alleging deficiencies in appellate briefing. Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 285 (2000). Ordinarily, a court evaluating whether appellate counsel performed deficiently either by omitting or failing to adequately present an issue must “look to the merits of the omitted issue.” Cargle v. Mullin, 317 F.3d 1196, 1202 (10th Cir. 2003) (quoting Neill v. Gibson, 278 F.3d 1044, 1057 (10th Cir. 2001)). And, in this context, an appellant must establish prejudice by “show[ing] a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel’s unreasonable failure to file a merits brief, he would have prevailed on his appeal.” Robbins, 528 U.S. at 285. B. Additional facts and OCCA decisions 1. Trial counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness Evidence presented at trial established that July ingested methamphetamine, possibly mixed with heroin, alcohol, and Xanax before and during the commission of the crimes for which he was convicted. See supra, background section I. Trial counsel requested an instruction on the defense of voluntary intoxication, citing this evidence and evidence that July experienced hallucinations and passed out at the Trenton Avenue house, but the trial court declined to give the instruction. Dkt. 15-11 at 125, 129-32, 276-84; Dkt. 15-12 at 14-18. Under Oklahoma law, a defendant asserting a voluntary intoxication defense must show: (1) the defendant was intoxicated and (2) the defendant “was ‘so utterly intoxicated, that his mental powers [were] overcome, rendering it impossible for [him] to form the specific criminal intent . . . element of the crime.’” Cuesta-Rodriguez v. State, 247 P.3d 1192, 1195 (Okla. Crim. App. 2011) (alterations and emphasis in original) (quoting Simpson v. State, 230 P.3d 888, 899 (Okla. Crim. App. 2010)). In declining to give the instruction, the trial court reasoned: The evidence that was presented was that [July] was drinking, that there were pills present, but that there was no evidence that he took the pills. There was no evidence that . . . his intoxication reached a level that he was so utterly intoxicated[] that his mental powers were overcome rendering it impossible for him to form specific criminal intent. In fact, as I reviewed the testimony, there was not evidence of his level of intoxication. Albeit, there was testimony that the defendant staggered and hit a wall and woke up and passed out again. There’s no evidence that that was subsequent or promulgated because of any injection of any intoxicant liquor or drugs. In fact, the testimony was clear from two items. It is that it appeared he knew exactly what he was doing when he was doing it with respect to the description of the assaults and the batteries that were testified to on the deceased. Dkt. 15-12 at 16-17. On direct appeal, July argued that Oklahoma law appears to “require” expert witness testimony to support a voluntary intoxication defense and that it was unreasonable for trial counsel not to call an expert witness who could testify about methamphetamine intoxication or psychosis exacerbated by alcohol use. Dkt. 14-1 at 19-25. July moved for an evidentiary hearing on this claim and, to support that request, submitted (1) the curriculum vitae of William H. Yarborough, M.D., and (2) and an affidavit from appellate counsel. Dkt. 14-2. Appellate counsel stated in his affidavit that: (1) he previously had retained Dr. Yarborough as an expert witness in a different case to testify about methamphetamine psychosis; (2) he lacked funds to retain Dr. Yarborough to interview July or review his case; (3) if granted an evidentiary hearing, he likely could “secure funds” to retain Dr. Yarborough who, in turn, might agree testify at the hearing; and (4) he believed that Dr. Yarborough “would be able to at least testify that the drug and alcohol intake of George July would have had an effect on his ability to form the specific intent to commit a crime in this case.” Id. at 27-28. The OCCA denied July’s request for an evidentiary hearing and denied his claim that trial counsel was ineffective. Dkt. 14-4 at 9-13. The OCCA acknowledged that state law imposes a “high standard” for raising a voluntary intoxication defense and requires more than evidence of “mere consumption” of alcohol or drugs or “conflicting evidence of a defendant’s level of intoxication,” but the OCCA rejected July’s argument that state law requires a defendant to present an expert witness to support that defense. Id. at 9-10. Addressing July’s application for an evidentiary hearing and considering the affidavits he submitted, the OCCA found that July did not “show . . . by clear and convincing evidence there is a strong possibility trial counsel was ineffective for failing to utilize or identify the complained-of evidence.” Id. at 10. The OCCA cited the trial court’s factual findings related to July’s request for a voluntary intoxication instruction and reasoned: In light of the trial court’s finding that [July] did not present a prima facie case of intoxication, [July’s] failure to present any evidence in his motion to remand for evidentiary hearing concerning a diagnosable mental illness or any evidence of the substances and their amounts consumed by [July] at the time of the crime so as to render him utterly intoxicated and his mental powers were overcome rendering it impossible for him to form the specific criminal intent element of the crime[,] and the admitted inability to know what Dr. Yarborough would testify to regarding [July’s] intent to commit the charged crimes dooms [July’s] request for an evidentiary hearing. The information contained in the motion fails to present clear and convincing evidence that there is a strong possibility trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present further evidence in support of a voluntary intoxication claim. Having thoroughly reviewed [July’s] application and affidavit, we conclude that [July] is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Id. at 11-12. The OCCA then stated, “Regarding the claim of ineffectiveness raised in the appellate brief, [July] has not shown trial counsel to be ineffective under the more rigorous federal standard set forth in Strickland for ineffective assistance of counsel.” Id. at 12. 2. Appellate counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness On postconviction appeal, July acknowledged that appellate counsel claimed trial counsel was ineffective for not hiring an expert witness or otherwise presenting a viable voluntary intoxication defense, but July argued that appellate counsel failed to present available evidence to support that claim. Dkt. 14-5 at 21-28. To support this argument, July submitted excerpts from police reports, highlighting witness descriptions of his use of controlled substances and alcohol and his behavior on November 9, 2013; his own affidavit and an affidavit from his ex-wife, both signed in 2017, describing his abuse of controlled substances in the months leading up to November 2013 and his ex-wife’s discussions with trial counsel about the possibility of hiring an expert witness; and an affidavit from Terese Hall, a licensed psychologist and board-certified forensic psychologist, who reviewed certain case materials, and opined that expert testimony about the effects of substance abuse “could have been helpful to the jury,” that an expert “could have assessed the possibility of a substance-induced psychotic disorder,” and that “there is a reasonable possibility that Mr. July could have been unable to form criminal intent because of the effects of methamphetamine and other substance ingestion on his mental processes, resulting in severe intoxication or drug-induced psychosis.” Id. at 117-46. Applying Strickland, the state district court denied relief. Dkt. 14-11 at 7-10. It reasoned, in part, that the affidavits from July and his ex-wife discussed July’s “purported drug use and its effects prior to the date of the offenses,” but did not “address the date of the offense itself,” or “provide evidence of the substances and their amounts consumed by [July] at the time of the crime.” Dkt. 14-11 at 10. Considering “the evidence presented by [July] in support of his application for post-conviction relief,” the state district court found no “reasonable probability that had [July’s] appellate counsel presented the evidence [July] claims counsel should have presented, the result of [July’s] appeal would have been different.” Id. On postconviction appeal, the OCCA identified Strickland as providing the controlling legal principles to evaluate July’s claim and denied relief, reasoning: [July] claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present an intoxication defense and, in turn, appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to assert trial counsel’s ineffectiveness. According to [July], prior counsel should have introduced evidence of his drug use and its effects on his behavior in support of an intoxication defense. However, the District Court found that even if the information referenced by [July in his application for postconviction relief] had been presented, nothing would have changed. The District Court’s conclusion is not an abuse of discretion. It follows that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected [July’s] claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. See Logan, 2013 OK CR 2, ¶ 11, 293 P.3d at 975 (“An assertion of ineffectiveness of appellate counsel based upon the failure to raise a meritless claim (or meritless claims) can be summarily rejected.”). Dkt. 14-14 at 3-4. C. Analysis and conclusion Respondent contends § 2254(d) bars relief as to both ineffective assistance of counsel claims because July has not shown that the OCCA’s adjudication of those claims resulted in decisions, either on direct or postconviction appeal, that are objectively unreasonable. Dkt. 14 at 12, 20-31. The Court agrees. Because the OCCA applied Strickland in rejecting both ineffective assistance of counsel claims, July must show that the OCCA’s adjudication of his claims resulted in decisions that either (1) involve an unreasonable application of Strickland’s legal principles to the facts of his case or (2) are based on an unreasonable determination of the facts presented in state court. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d); see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 406 (2000) (explaining that “a run-of-the-mill state- court decision applying the correct legal rule from our cases to the facts of a prisoner’s case would not fit comfortably within § 2254(d)(1)’s ‘contrary to’ clause”). On federal habeas review, “[e]stablishing that a state court’s application of Strickland was unreasonable under § 2254(d) is . . . difficult” because “[t]he standards created by ‘and § 2254(d) are both highly deferential and when the two apply in tandem, review is doubly so.” Richter, 562 U.S. at 105 (cleaned up). And because Strickland provides a general rule for state courts to apply, “the range of reasonable applications is substantial.” Id. July barely references the standards that guide this Court’s review of his claims and makes no discernible effort to satisfy them. Dkt. 6 at 15-24. Instead, he discusses Strickland, reasserts the arguments he presented in his application for postconviction relief, and appears to ask this Court to review one or both of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims de novo. Id. at 16-22. But the question for this Court is not whether either of his attorneys performed so deficiently as to prejudice the outcome of his trial and appeal; rather, the question for this Court is whether the OCCA had any reasonable basis to reject his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Richter, 562 U.S. at 105. July has not shown that the OCCA’s decisions are “so obviously wrong” that no fairminded jurists would agree with them. Kayer, 592 U.S. at 118. To the extent July mentions the OCCA’s decisions, he appears to contend both are objectively unreasonable because: (1) the OCCA “denied relief and an evidentiary hearing on the basis that appellate counsel failed to present evidence to support it”; (2) the state district court effectively disregarded the evidence July marshaled to support his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim; and (3) on postconviction appeal, the OCCA “did not engage in any analysis of the evidence presented by July, nor the opinion of Dr. Hall, but held simply and conclusory that the state district court decision [denying postconviction relief] was not an abuse of discretion.” Id. at 23-24. In his closing sentence, July asserts that “[t]he opinions of the OCCA both on direct appeal and in denying post-conviction relief are objective unreasonable and July is entitled to habeas relief.” Id. at 24. None of these contentions is persuasive. First, July’s “broad, conclusory statement” that the OCCA’s decisions “are objective unreasonable” is “insufficient to carry [his] burden” to show that § 2254(d) does not bar relief. Meek v. Martin, 74 F.4th 1223, 1267 (10th Cir. 2023). Second, it is not clear from July’s brief, which largely focuses on evidence marshaled for postconviction proceedings, why it was objectively unreasonable for the OCCA to reject the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim raised on direct appeal after considering the trial record and appellate counsel’s speculations about what testimony Dr. Yarborough might offer if he were hired to testify at an evidentiary hearing. Dkt. 6 at 16-24. Moreover, July’s argument that appellate counsel did not offer sufficient evidence to establish trial counsel’s ineffectiveness directly undermines any argument July might be making that the OCCA unreasonably rejected his admittedly unsupported ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim. Third, the record belies July’s contention that the state district court ignored the evidence he presented in his state postconviction proceeding to establish appellate counsel’s ineffectiveness. Rather, the state district court considered that evidence and carefully explained why it did not support a finding that appellate counsel’s allegedly deficient performance prejudiced the outcome of July’s appeal. Dkt. 14-11 at 7-10. Fourth, to the extent July critiques the OCCA’s postconviction decision based on the absence of specific references to the evidence that the state court had already carefully considered or the absence of “serious legal analysis” of his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim, July’s criticisms do not come close to showing that the OCCA unreasonably applied Strickland or unreasonably determined the facts relevant to his claims. Critically, the Constitution does not require state courts to show their work in anticipation of federal habeas review. See e.g., Johnson v. Williams, 568 U.S. 289, 300 (2013) (noting that “federal courts have no authority to impose mandatory opinion- writing standards on state courts”); Coleman, 501 U.S. at 739 (“[W]e have no power to tell state courts how they must write their opinions.”). Even when “a state court’s decision is unaccompanied by an explanation, the habeas petitioner’s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.” Richter, 562 U.S. at 98. July has not met that burden. On the record presented, the Court finds and concludes that July has not met his initial burden to show that the OCCA’s decisions on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims are objectively unreasonable, much less his ultimate burden to show that law and justice require this Court to grant federal habeas relief on those claims. The Court therefore denies the petition as to the claims asserted in grounds one and two. III. Indian country jurisdiction (ground three) July claims the State did not have jurisdiction to prosecute him because he is an enrolled member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation with some degree of Indian blood and crimes he committed within the Cherokee Nation Reservation are enumerated in the MCA and thus subject to federal criminal jurisdiction. Dkt. 1 at 8; Dkt. 6 at 25-29. A. Clearly established federal law Under the MCA, only the federal government has jurisdiction to prosecute certain crimes, including murder, kidnapping and felony assault, that are committed by Indians within “Indian country.” 18 U.S.C. § 1153(a); see McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. 894, 932 (2020) (“[T]he MCA applies to Oklahoma according to its usual terms: Only the federal government, not the State, may prosecute Indians for major crimes committed in Indian country.”); id. at 934 (“When Congress adopted the MCA, it broke many treaty promises that had once allowed tribes like the Creeks to try their own members. But, in return, Congress allowed only the federal government, not the States, to try tribal members for major crimes.”); see also 18 U.S.C. § 1151 (defining “Indian country”); United States v. Hatley, ___ F.4th ___, 2025 WL 2553109, at * 7 (10th Cir. Sept. 5, 2025) (quoting the plain language of the MCA and stating “§ 1153 confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over ‘[a]ny Indian who commits against the person or property of another Indian or other person’ any of the offenses enumerated in the statute” (emphasis in original)). Because the relevant federal statutes do not define the term “Indian,” federal courts apply a two-part test to determine if a criminal defendant is Indian. That test requires a court to “make factual findings that the defendant ‘(1) has some Indian blood; and (2) is recognized as an Indian by a tribe or by the federal government.’” United States v. Prentiss, 273 F.3d 1277, 1280 (10th Cir. 2001) (quoting Scrivner v. Tansy, 68 F.3d 1234, 1241 (10th Cir. 1995)). In Hatley, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (“Tenth Circuit”) held, as a matter of first impression in this circuit, that, “when proving a defendant’s Indian status, the government can only satisfy the second prong of the Prentiss II test by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was recognized as an Indian at the time of the charged offense.” Hatley, 2025 WL 2553109, at *8; accord United States v. Zepeda, 792 F.3d 1103, 1113 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (holding that “the government must prove that the defendant was an Indian at the time of the offense with which the defendant is charged” to establish Indian status for purposes of federal prosecution under the MCA). In this circuit, “[t]he issue of whether the state court properly exercised jurisdiction” over an Indian who committed major crimes in Indian country is “an important federal constitutional question” and the “[a]bsence of jurisdiction in the convicting court is . . . a basis for federal habeas corpus relief cognizable under the due process clause.” Yellowbear v. Wyo. Atty. Gen., 525 F.3d 921, 924 (10th Cir. 2008) (citing Supreme Court precedent).8 8 Respondent urges the Court to deny relief on July’s Indian country jurisdiction claim, in part, because: (1) “no Supreme Court law clearly establishes that federal prosecutorial authority under the MCA . . . is exclusive of state authority” and (2) “no Supreme Court law clearly establishes that a state prosecution in violation of the MCA . . . is redressable on habeas review.” Dkt. 14 at 39-63. Based on the Court’s foregoing discussion of clearly established federal law, the Court rejects these arguments. A. Additional facts and OCCA decision July raised his Indian country jurisdiction claim in his 2017 application for postconviction relief. In support of this claim, July cited the MCA, Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U.S. 463 (1984), and Murphy v. Royal, 866 F.3d 1164 (10th Cir. Aug. 8, 2017), amended and superseded on denial of reh’g by 875 F.3d 896 (10th Cir. 2017) (“Murphy I”), aff'd sub nom. Sharp v. Murphy, 591 U.S. 977 (2020) (“Murphy II”). Dkt. 14-5, at 11-20. In Murphy I, the Tenth Circuit considered a habeas petitioner’s challenge to the State’s allegedly improper exercise of criminal jurisdiction in Indian country that the petitioner first raised in state court through a second postconviction appeal. 875 F.3d at 907-09. Applying Bartlett, the Tenth Circuit held that because Congress has not disestablished the Muscogee (Creek) Nation Reservation, the land within the boundaries of that reservation is “Indian country” for purposes of the MCA. Murphy I, 875 F.3d at 966.9 In his application for postconviction relief, July asked the state district court to apply Bartlett’s framework to determine whether Congress had disestablished the Cherokee Nation Reservation and July attached several exhibits (e.g., maps and treaties) to aid the state district court in performing that task. Dkt. 14-5 at 11-20, 32-35, 40-92. July also attached exhibits showing that he has a degree of Indian blood and is an enrolled member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. Id. at 36-39. In March 2018, the State moved to abate July’s state postconviction proceeding until the matter in Murphy I was “settled.” Dkt. 14-6 at 1. In July 2020, the Supreme Court issued decisions in McGirt and Murphy II. In McGirt, an Oklahoma prisoner petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the OCCA’s 9 The Tenth Circuit stayed issuance of the mandate in Murphy I for 90 days or until the deadline passed for filing a petition for writ of certiorari. The respondent in that case filed a petition for writ of certiorari, and the Supreme Court granted that petition in May 2018. Royal v. Murphy, 584 U.S. 992 (2018). decision denying his application for postconviction relief. See McGirt v. Oklahoma, 140 S. Ct. 659 (2019) (granting petition for writ of certiorari). Like the habeas petitioner in Murphy I, the prisoner in McGirt claimed that because he is an Indian, the federal government should have prosecuted him for major crimes he committed within the boundaries of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation Reservation. McGirt, 591 U.S. at 898 ; Murphy I, 875 F.3d at 928. The question presented in McGirt was whether the land promised to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation through treaties signed by the United States in 1832 and 1833 “remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law.” 591 U.S. at 897. The McGirt Court held that because Congress did not disestablish the Muscogee (Creek) Nation Reservation the land within the boundaries of that reservation is “Indian country,” as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1151(a), and, as a result, the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction, under the MCA, to prosecute certain crimes committed by Indians within those boundaries. McGirt, 591 U.S. at 913, 933-34. Relying on its decision in McGirt, the Supreme Court in Murphy II summarily affirmed the Tenth Circuit's decision in Murphy I. Murphy II, 591 U.S. at 978. The McGirt Court recognized that its decision might “risk[] upsetting some convictions” because Oklahoma had been prosecuting Indians for crimes committed in Indian country since statehood, despite the “plain terms” of the MCA. 591 U.S. at 924-34. But the McGirt Court reasoned that “[o]ther defendants who do try to challenge their state convictions may face significant procedural obstacles, thanks to well-known state and federal limitations on postconviction review in criminal proceedings.” Id. at 932-33. After the Supreme Court issued its decision in McGirt, July moved the state district court for an order directing the State to respond to his 2017 application for postconviction relief, and the matter was fully briefed in April 2021. Dkt. 14-7; Dkt. 14-11 at 1. Nearly one year later, the state district court denied July’s application. Dkt. 1-1. The state district court found that July became an enrolled citizen of the Muscogee Creek Nation in November 2005, that he has a significant degree of Creek Blood, and that he committed his crimes within the Muscogee Creek Nation Reservation and/or the Cherokee Nation Reservation.10 Id. at 3. Nonetheless, the state district court denied relief based on the OCCA’s decision in State ex rel. Matloff v. Wallace, 497 P.3d 686 (Okla. Crim. App. 2021). Id. at 5-7. In Wallace, the OCCA “exercise[ed] [its] independent state law authority to interpret the remedial scope of the state post-conviction statutes” and held that the McGirt Court “announced a new rule of criminal procedure” and that the McGirt decision does not “apply retroactively in a state post-conviction proceeding to void a final conviction.” Wallace, 497 P.3d at 688-89, 694. The state district court reasoned that Wallace precluded relief because July’s conviction became final in 2016. Dkt. 1-1 at 6-7. July appealed, and the OCCA likewise relied on Wallace to affirm the denial of postconviction relief. Dkt. 1-2 at 2-3. The OCCA declined July’s “invitation to revisit [its] holding in” Wallace. Id. at 3.11 10 While July’s application for postconviction relief was pending, the OCCA held in a different case that the Cherokee Nation Reservation is Indian country, as defined in § 1151(a). Hogner v. State, 500 P.3d 629, 635 (Okla. Crim. App. 2021), overruled in part on other grounds by Deo v. Parish, 541 P.3d 833 (Okla. Crim. App. 2023). 11 When the state courts adjudicated July’s claim, neither state court suggested that he waived it by failing to raise it at the trial court level or on direct appeal. See Dkts. 1-1, 1-2. At that time, Oklahoma law provided that “subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and can be raised at any time” and state courts generally treated McGirt-based claims as implicating subject matter jurisdiction. See Deo v. Parish, 541 P.3d 833, 835-38 (Okla. Crim. App. 2023). In Deo, however, the OCCA concluded that “subject matter jurisdiction considers the type of controversy before the district court, not the parties, territory, or sovereigns at issue.” Id. at 838. The OCCA stated that it was “no longer convinced that Congress has preempted Oklahoma State Courts’ subject matter jurisdiction” and that it had “become[] clear that Congress has chosen to exercise its authority over a particular territory (Indian Country) and over a particular people (Indians), not a type of controversy, at most preempting Oklahoma’s territorial and personal jurisdiction over Indians in Indian Country.” Id. at 837. See also, City of Tulsa v. O’Brien, ___ P.3d ___, 2024 WL 5001684 (Okla. Crim. App. Dec. 5, 2024) (describing Deo as holding “that Indian country jurisdictional claims do not implicate Oklahoma district courts’ subject matter jurisdiction, but rather personal and territorial jurisdiction”). C. Analysis and conclusion Respondent urges the Court to deny relief on this claim, in part, because the OCCA’s decision is based on an independent and adequate state procedural rule, namely the Wallace rule, and July has not made the showings necessary to overcome the procedural default of this claim. Dkt. 14 at 63-92.12 The Court agrees. As previously discussed, when a state court denies a federal claim based on an independent and adequate state procedural rule, the prisoner has procedurally defaulted that claim for purposes of federal habeas review. Davila, 582 U.S. at 527; Coleman, 501 U.S. at 732. When “the state pleads the affirmative defense of an independent and adequate state procedural bar, the burden to place that defense in issue shifts to the petitioner.” Hooks v. Ward, 184 F.3d 1206, 1217 (10th Cir. 1999). A state procedural rule is adequate if the rule is “firmly established and regularly followed.” Beard v. Kindler, 558 U.S. 53, 60 (2009) (quoting Lee v. Kemna, 534 U.S. 362, 376 (2002)). And a state procedural rule is independent if the rule relies on state law, rather than federal law. Simpson v. Carpenter, 912 F.3d 542, 571 (10th Cir. 2018). “[A]t a minimum,” the petitioner must come forward with “specific allegations . . . as to the inadequacy of the state procedure” and “[t]he scope of the state’s burden of proof thereafter will be measured by the specific claims of inadequacy put forth by the petitioner.” Id. July did not file a reply brief to respond to Respondent’s argument that the Wallace rule provides an independent and adequate state law ground to support the OCCA’s rejection of his Indian country jurisdiction claim. However, in his brief, July presents several arguments regarding 12 Alternatively, Respondent contends that § 2254(d) bars relief to the extent it states a cognizable habeas claim, and that this claim would fail on de novo review because it is barred by the non-retroactivity rule of Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989). Dkt. 14 at 92-133. Because the Court agrees that this claim is procedurally barred, the Court declines to address these alternative arguments. the Wallace rule. Generally, July “objects to the holding of Wallace and its application to his case, and views it as wrongly decided and in direct conflict with McGirt.” Dkt. 6 at 26. More specifically, he contends “the OCCA is incorrect as a matter of federal law that McGirt announced a new rule of criminal procedure” because, in July’s view, McGirt announced “a substantive rule of criminal law.” Id. at 27 (emphasis in original). He further contends that because “Jimcy McGirt has received the benefit of the McGirt ruling,” he should receive that same benefit to avoid being “singled out arbitrarily in violation of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause.” Id. Next, he contends imprisoning him, and other Native Americans, “when the State has no lawful power to do so violates . . . substantive Due Process.” Id. He also contends “there is no rational or legal principle that says that Wallace itself must be applied retroactively” and emphasizes that the state district court did not rule on his 2017 application for postconviction relief until 2022. Id. at 27-28. Lastly, July contends the OCCA “has no authority to deem a decision of the Supreme Court retroactive or not” because “[t]hat power is left to the Supreme Court itself under the principles of retroactivity outlined in” Teague. Id. at 28-29. Though not well developed, July’s arguments appear to ask this Court to consider whether the OCCA wrongly decided Wallace. But that question is not before this Court in this habeas action. Because the OCCA rejected July’s Indian country jurisdiction claim based on a procedural rule, without reaching the merits, the only questions for this Court are (1) whether the Wallace rule is independent of federal law; (2) whether the OCCA regularly follows it in denying postconviction relief; and (3) if so, whether July has shown that he can overcome the procedural default of this claim. July’s arguments do not fairly address any of these questions. In contrast, Respondent shows that the OCCA has applied the Wallace rule in more than 350 cases since Wallace was decided. Dkt. 14 at 73; Dkts. 14-19, 14-20. On this record, the Court finds that the Wallace rule is adequate because it is “firmly established and regularly followed.” Beard, 558 U.S. at 60. The Court further finds that the Wallace rule is independent of federal law. True, the OCCA discussed federal law, including Teague, in reaching its decision that it would not retroactively apply McGirt to in state postconviction proceedings, but the OCCA also clearly expressed that its ultimate decision on that issue rests on independent state law grounds. Wallace, 497 P.3d at 688-89, 694. Under Supreme Court precedent, that clear expression is sufficient to establish that the Wallace rule is “independent” of federal law. See Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1041 (1983) (“If a state court chooses merely to rely on federal precedents as it would on the precedents of all other jurisdictions, then it need only make clear by a plain statement in its judgment or opinion that the federal cases are being used only for the purpose of guidance, and do not themselves compel the result that the court has reached.”); Simpson, 912 F.3d at 571.13 In sum, the Court finds that the OCCA applied an independent and adequate state procedural rule to deny postconviction relief on July’s Indian country jurisdiction claim, resulting in a procedural default of this claim. To obtain habeas review of this claim, July first must show either cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice from the alleged constitutional error or that this Court’s failure to review the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. Davila, 582 U.S. at 527; Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750. July neither acknowledges the procedural default of this claim nor attempts to show that he can overcome the procedural default. Instead, July’s arguments focus on 13 At least two federal district judges in Oklahoma, including the undersigned, previously have concluded that the OCCA’s Wallace rule is an independent and adequate procedural rule that, when applied to a federal claim challenging the state’s allegedly improper exercise of criminal jurisdiction in Indian country, results in a procedural default of that federal claim. See Patterson v. Harpe, No. 18-CV-0153-GKF-JFJ, 2025 WL 1908975, at *16 (N.D. Okla. July 10, 2025) (slip copy); Dkt. 19-1, Fitzer v. Hamilton, No. CIV-18-283-RAW-GLJ (E.D. Okla. Jan. 2, 2025) (unpublished). While neither case is binding on this Court, the Court finds the reasoning in Patterson and Fitzer persuasive. the merits of his Indian country jurisdiction claim and assert that the OCCA wrongly decided Wallace. Dkt. 6 at 25-29.14 Because July procedurally defaulted the Indian country jurisdiction claim and has not shown any basis for this Court to excuse the procedural default, the Court denies the petition as to ground three. CONCLUSION The Court concludes that July has not made the necessary showings to obtain federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254. The Court therefore denies the petition as to all three grounds for relief raised therein. However, because the Court concludes that reasonable jurists could debate whether claim three states a substantial constitutional claim and could debate the Court’s determination that relief on that claim is barred by an adequate and independent state procedural rule, the Court grants a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the rule announced by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in State ex rel. Matloff v. Wallace, 497 P.3d 686 (Okla. Crim. App. 2021), is an independent and adequate state procedural rule that bars relief as to Patterson’s claim that he was denied due process when the State of Oklahoma exercised criminal jurisdiction to prosecute him for crimes he committed in Indian country. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c); Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000). 14 As previously stated, July did not file an optional reply brief to respond to any arguments Respondent raised in the response. Further, after the Court granted Respondent’s motion file a supplemental brief addressing the Fitzer decision, see supra n.13, and provided July the opportunity to also file a supplemental brief addressing the Fitzer decision, July did not file a supplemental brief. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that: 1. the Clerk of Court shall note on the record the substitution of Scott Tinsley, Interim Warden, in place of Janet Dowling as party respondent; 2. the petition for writ of habeas corpus (Dkt. 1) is denied; 3. a certificate of appealability is granted on the following issue: whether the rule announced by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in State ex rel. Matloff v. Wallace, 497 P.3d 686 (Okla. Crim. App. 2021), is an independent and adequate state procedural rule that bars relief as to July’s claim that he was denied due process when the State of Oklahoma exercised criminal jurisdiction to prosecute him for crimes he committed in Indian country; and 4. aseparate judgment shall be entered in this matter.

MEMORANDUM & ORDER SISON, Magistrate Judge: INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Pending before the Court is Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 112, 113, 123). Specifically, Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment as Plaintiff has failed to produce evidence establishing that it discriminated against him because of Plaintiff’s race. This is because Defendant had a legitimate reason for placing Plaintiff on administrative leave and suspending his employment, and Plaintiff has not offered evidence establishing the proffered reasons were pretextual. Plaintiff opposes the motion arguing that he has made a prima facie case of rase discrimination and that he has provided evidence Defendant’s reasons were pretextual and motivated by racial discrimination. (Doc. 115).1 For the reasons outlined below, the Court GRANTS the motion. 1 The Court notes that Plaintiff did not follow the Local Rules in responding to Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff did not respond to Defendant’s statement of facts as required by the Local Rules. See Local Rule 56.1(b). Further, Plaintiff, in his “Statement of Facts” On November 29, 2021, Plaintiff Alnando Sisson (“Sisson”) filed an amended complaint against the Illinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”) alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”). (Doc. 48). Sisson, who at the time of the events was a Correctional Officer at Southwestern Correctional Center (“Southwestern”), alleges that he was discriminated against because of his race following a physical altercation at work on December 12, 2017, with fellow Correctional Officer Joseph Kinsey. He alleges that he was placed on administrative leave and suspended from his employment following this altercation. FACTS2 Sisson, an African American male, began working for the IDOC in 1998. He served as a Correctional Officer at Southwestern for approximately 19 years prior to the altercation. During his tenure at IDOC, Sisson was promoted several times. Currently, he is employed as a Correctional Lieutenant at Centralia Correctional Center (“Centralia”). On December 12, 2017, near the beginning of the midnight shift around 10:00 p.m., a physical altercation occurred between Sisson and Correctional Officer Kinsey at Southwestern.3 Correctional Officer Joseph Kinsey is a white male. Prior to the and “Adverse Employment Actions Against Plaintiff” did not cite to the record, except for citing to his own deposition, as required by the Local Rules. See Local Rule 56.1(c). 2 In accordance with Local Rule 56.1(f) and (g), the Court disregards facts not supported with a citation to the record, and the Court deems admitted material facts that have not been specifically disputed. 3 Sisson testified to the following about the incident: Q. Okay. Why did you approach Mr. Kinsey? A. There was a report from a female correctional officer to me as union steward at the time that she was being verbally harassed by Correctional Officer Kinsey. . . . A. I went to him, said, hey, I’m a union steward. It’s reported to me by female staff that he was harassing and bullying her. . . . I identified myself, told him who I was, and told him only that a female staff reported something to me. At that particular time the first words out of his mouth was: Fuck you, as in me. Get the fuck out of my face. . . . Q. So when he said that to you, did he touch you in any manner? A. No, not at that time. Q. What happened after he said that to you? A. After he said that, I told him who I was again and told him I’m coming at him in a professional manner and that I’m not speaking to him in an incorrect manner. I did not use any curse words or anything. Then that’s when he said it again. Q. Okay. And then what happened after he said it again? A. At that moment I broke down to him what I had knew about the situation that was brought to me. I told him it was inappropriate, it was unprofessional, and we both should be professional as staff members. Q. Okay. Then what happened? A. At that particular moment we just kind of going back and forth, which I was doing the majority of the talking, and which I think he began to get agitated, and that’s when he took his radio and took a swing at me. Q. Okay. Did he take a swing at you with his radio or something else? A. Yes, his radio was in his – his radio was in his right hand. Q. Did it strike you? Did the radio strike you? A. Luckily – luckily, no, sir, it did not. Q. Okay. What happened after that? A. After I ducked out of the way of the radio, I remember I punched him a couple of times. He grabbed me. I grabbed him. He tried to use the van as momentum to kick me, and that’s when I slammed him out of the van because he was – he was holding onto the door and the van to try to kick me, and he – and I grabbed him off the van and slammed him to the ground. Q. Were either you or Kinsey carrying a weapon at that time? A. At that time as an outer patrol assignment, CO Kinsey should have had a weapon somewhere on him maybe. Q. Did you see of that weapon ever dislodged during this confrontation? A. No, I did not. . . . Q. At any time were you on top of Kinsey? A. Yes. Q. Okay. How so? A. After I slammed him to the ground, I was on top of him, and instead of me hitting him, I think I grabbed him and told him don’t ever try to swing at me, threaten me again. Q. And did you every physically strike him with your fist or your feet or legs? altercation, Sisson worked a different shift than Correctional Officer Kinsey, and the two had little interaction with each other. Correctional Sergeant Eddie Rumph, an African American male, and Correctional Sergeant Ronald Swanson, an African American male, witnessed the altercation and prepared incident reports.4 Sisson’s Correctional Sergeant, Claude Heimburger, a white male, responded to the incident but did not witness the incident. Major Gary MacQuarrie, a white male, also responded to the incident. After observing Correctional Officer Kinsey with a bloody lip and swelling to his left cheek area, Major MacQuarrie instructed Correctional Officer Kinsey to visit healthcare. Correctional Officer Kinsey indicated that he wanted to press charges against Sisson. At no point during the altercation was Sisson’s race mentioned.5 As a result of the altercation, Sisson was placed on paid administrative leave from December 14, 2017, through June 29, 2018. A. I struck him with my fist at the beginning of the confrontation after he swung the radio at me. Q. What part of – did you actually strike any part of his body with your fist? A. Yes, I struck the left side of his face with my right fist. (Doc. 113-1, p. 29, 37-40). 4 During the altercation, Rumph witnessed Sisson on top of Kinsey, but did not see him throwing punches. (Doc. 115-1, p. 14, 17). Also, during the altercation, Swanson witnessed Sisson walking to Kinsey’s outer patrol van, saw Sisson standing in between the van door and Kinsey, saw the van rocking side to side, and saw Sisson’s body and arms moving as if throwing “blows.” Id at p. 19, 21. 5 Plaintiff further testified to the following in his deposition: Q. And so during this confrontation at any point did Ken make any reference to your race? A. No, not that I heard. (Doc. 113-1, p. 40). Eventually, the Illinois State Police (“ISP”) was contacted, and the ISP initiated a criminal investigation, 18CF767. On May 22, 2018, Sisson was arrested for felony aggravated battery. That same day, the Employee Review Board (“ERB”) held a hearing to determine whether Sisson should be suspended for violating multiple employee rules. On June 30, 2018, Sisson was suspended without pay pending the outcome of the criminal charges. This determination was signed by Major C. Davis, an African American female, and Warden Ron Vitale, a white male. On November 26, 2018, a bench trial was held on Sisson’s criminal charges. Sisson was acquitted, and the criminal charges were dismissed. Sisson returned to work for the IDOC on December 2, 2018, after the dismissal of the criminal charges. Sisson was transferred to Centralia. At Centralia, Sisson applied for and was promoted to Correctional Sergeant. Thereafter, he applied for and was promoted to Correctional Lieutenant. Correctional Officer Kinsey was not arrested, and the ERB did not hold a hearing as to him. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings and affidavits “show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. PROC. 56(c); Oates v. Discovery Zone, 116 F.3d 1161, 1165 (7th Cir. 1997) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986)). The movant bears the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. See Santaella v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 123 F.3d 456, 461 (7th Cir. 1997) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323). This Court must consider the entire record, drawing reasonable inferences and resolving factual disputes in favor of the non-movant. See Regensburger v. China Adoption Consultants, Ltd., 138 F.3d 1201, 1205 (7th Cir. 1998) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986)). See also Smith v. Hope School, 560 F.3d 694, 699 (7th Cir. 2009) (stating that “we are not required to draw every conceivable inference from the record . . . we draw only reasonable inferences”) (internal citations omitted). Summary judgment is also appropriate if a plaintiff cannot make a showing of an essential element of his claim. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. While the Court may not “weigh evidence or engage in fact- finding [,]” it must determine if a genuine issue remains for trial. Lewis v. City of Chicago, 496 F.3d 645, 651 (7th Cir. 2007). In response to a motion for summary judgment, the non-movant may not simply rest on the allegations in his pleadings; rather, he must show through specific evidence that an issue of fact remains on matters for which he bears the burden of proof at trial. See Walker v. Shansky, 28 F.3d 666, 670–671 (7th Cir. 1994) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324). No issue remains for trial “unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the non-moving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party . . . if the evidence is merely colorable, or is not sufficiently probative, summary judgment may be granted.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249–250 (citations omitted). Accord Starzenski v. City of Elkhart, 87 F.3d 872, 880 (7th Cir. 1996); Tolle v. Carroll Touch, Inc., 23 F.3d 174, 178 (7th Cir. 1994). In other words, “inferences relying on mere speculation or conjecture will not suffice.” Trade Finance Partners, LLC v. AAR Corp., 573 F.3d 401, 407 (7th Cir. 2009) (internal citation omitted). See also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252 (finding that “[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the [non-movant's] position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-movant]”). Instead, the non-moving party must present “definite, competent evidence to rebut the [summary judgment] motion.” EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 233 F.3d 432, 437 (7th Cir. 2000) (internal citation omitted). Finally, at the summary judgment stage it is not the Court’s role to “sift through the evidence, pondering the nuances and inconsistencies, and decide whom to believe.” D.Z. v. Buell, 796 F.3d 749, 756 (7th Cir. 2015) (citing Waldridge v. American Hoechst Corp., 24 F.3d 918, 920 (7th Cir. 1994). See also Boss v. Castro, 816 F.3d 910, 914 (7th Cir. 2016) (noting that courts are not required to scour the record looking for factual disputes or piece together appropriate arguments). Instead, the Court “is only tasked with deciding whether, based on the evidence of the record, there is any material dispute of fact that requires a trial.” Buell, 796 F.3d at 756. Additionally, as outlined in Local Rule 56.1(g), “[a]ll material facts set forth in a Statement of Material Facts or a Statement of Additional Material Facts shall be deemed admitted for purposes of summary judgment unless specifically disputed.” Consequently, when a party fails to respond as outlined in Local Rule 56.1, “we depart from our usual deference towards the non-moving party” and accept all of the moving parties' “unopposed material facts as true.” Apex Digital, Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 735 F.3d 962, 965 (7th Cir. 2013). “Nevertheless, the Court is cognizant that ‘a nonmovant's failure to respond to a summary judgment motion, or failure to comply with Local Rule 56.1, does not, of course, automatically result in judgment for the movant. [The movant] must still demonstrate that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” Pratt v. Bebout, Case No. 3:21-CV-1262-MAB, 2024 WL 1013920, at *3 (S.D. Ill. March 8, 2024) (quoting Keeton v. Morningstar, Inc., 667 F.3d 877, 884 (7th Cir. 2012)). DISCUSSION At summary judgment, the “singular question” for the district court is whether the plaintiff has introduced evidence that would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the employer took an adverse action against him because of a statutorily proscribed factor – in this case, race. Purtue v. Wisconsin Department of Corrections, 963 F.3d 598, 602 (7th Cir. 2020) (citing Johnson v. Advocate Health & Hospitals Corporation, 892 F.3d 887, 894 (7th Cir. 2018)). See also Abrego v. Wilkie, 907 F.3d 1004, 1012 (7th Cir. 2018) (stating that “[t]o succeed on a Title VII claim, the plaintiff-employee must prove three elements: [1] he is a member of a class protected by the statute, [2] that he has been the subject of some form of adverse employment action . . . and [3] that the employer took this adverse action on account of the plaintiff's membership in the protected class.”). To answer that question, the court must evaluate all the relevant, admissible evidence. See, e.g., Ortiz v. Werner Enterprises, Inc., 834 F.3d 760, 766 (7th Cir. 2016) (stating that “all evidence belongs in a single pile and must be evaluated as a whole.”). See also Chatman v. Board of Education of City of Chicago, 5 F.4th 738, 746 (7th Cir. 2021) (the court must “look at the evidence holistically.”); David v. Board of Trustees of Community College District No. 508, 846 F.3d 216, 224 (7th Cir. 2017) (noting that “Ortiz explicitly instructed district courts to stop separating ‘direct’ from ‘indirect’ evidence and proceeding as if they were subject to different legal standards.”). A discrimination claim can be analyzed using the burden-shifting framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). See Chatman, 5 F.4th at 746; Purtue, 963 F.3d at 601–602; Lewis v. Wilkie, 909 F.3d 858, 866 (7th Cir. 2018); David, 846 F.3d at 224. The McDonnell Douglas approach requires the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of discrimination without proving a direct causal link by showing that: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he met the employer’s legitimate job expectations; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) similarly situated employees outside of the protected class were treated more favorably. See Lauderdale v. Illinois Department of Human Services, 876 F.3d 904, 910 (7th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted); Lewis, 909 F.3d at 866; David, 846 F.3d at 225 (citation omitted). If the plaintiff can establish a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to “articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for the actions taken against the plaintiff. David, 846 F.3d at 225. The plaintiff must then “submit evidence that the employer’s explanation is pretextual.” David, 846 F.3d at 225. However, the plaintiff need not rely on the McDonnell Douglas framework to establish a case of race discrimination. See Purtue, 963 F.3d at 601–602; Joll v. Valparaiso Community Schools, 953 F.3d 923, 929 (7th Cir. 2020); David, 846 F.3d at 224. Instead, the plaintiff can proffer direct or circumstantial evidence that satisfies the elements of the discrimination claim and “point[s] directly to a discriminatory reason for the employer’s action.” Boss v. Castro, 816 F.3d 910, 917 (7th Cir. 2016). See also Joll, 953 F.3d at 929; Lewis v. Wilkie, 909 F.3d 858, 866 (7th Cir. 2018) (staring that “[t]he direct method requires the plaintiff to simply present evidence satisfying the elements of the [discrimination] claim . . . .”). There are three broad types of circumstantial evidence that will support an inference of intentional discrimination: “ambiguous or suggestive comments or conduct; better treatment of people similarly situated but for the protected characteristic; and dishonest employer justifications for disparate treatment.” Purtue, 963 F.3d at 602 (quoting Joll, 953 F.3d at 929). The McDonnell Douglas framework is relevant as Sisson contests the reasons for him being placed on paid administrative leave and placed on suspension and asserts that those reasons were pretextual.6 Defendant argues that Sisson failed to show that his race was a motivating factor as to either him being placed on paid administrative leave on December 13, 2017, or him being suspended from employment on June 20, 2018. Specifically, Defendant argues that it had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for placing Sisson on paid administrative leave on December 13, 2017, i.e., the physical altercation with Officer Kinsey, who had visible injuries from that altercation. It also had legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for suspending Sisson’s employment on June 30, 2018, i.e., his May 22, 2018 arrest for felony aggravated battery, and the ERB, after holding a hearing on May 22, 2018, finding that 6 For the purposes of this motion, the Court need not address whether Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of race discrimination. The Court instead focuses on the issue of pretext. See, e.g., Lesch v. Crown Cork & Seal Co., 282 F.3d 467, 473 (7th Cir. 2002) (stating that “[i]t is not always necessary to march through this entire process [analysis of a prima facie case] if a single issue proves to be dispositive. Here, as is often true, that issue is pretext or the lack thereof.”). Sisson violated employee rules during the December 12, 2017, incident.7 Sisson avers that the explanations are pretextual as Officer Kinsey was not disciplined, investigated, or placed on paid administrative leave or suspended for his actions in the altercation and that Defendant has not explained why Officer Kinsey was treated differently. The Court agrees with Defendant. “Pretext is a lie, specifically a phony reason for some action.” Fischer v. Avanade, Inc., 519 F.3d 393, 403 (7th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, “to show pretext, a plaintiff must show that (1) the employer's nondiscriminatory reason was dishonest; and (2) the employer's true reason was based on a discriminatory intent.” Id. “Pretext does not exist if the decisionmaker honestly believed the nondiscriminatory reason given by an employer for an adverse employment action.” Downing v. Abbott Laboratories, 48 F.4th 793, 804 (7th Cir. 2022) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). “So, in evaluating pretext, the focus is on what the decisionmakers knew, and their perceptions are ‘controlling.’” Id. (quoting Stockwell v. City of Harvey, 597 F.3d 895, 902 (7th Cir. 2010)). “[T]he pretext inquiry turns on honesty, not correctness, and even if we assume a less severe punishment might have been more 7 Defendant also argues that being placed on paid administrative leave is not an adverse employment decision. The Court agrees with Defendant that in this case Sisson being placed on paid administrative leave is not an adverse employment action. See, e.g., Nichols v. Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville, 510 F.3d 722, 786-787 (7th Cir. 2007) (holding that placing an officer on paid administrative leave pending the conclusion of an investigation is not a materially adverse action). However, assuming arguendo that it is an adverse employment action, the Court will address Plaintiff being placed on paid administrative leave. appropriate, that fact does not, without more, provide evidence of pretext.” Liu v. Cook County, 817 F.3d 307, 318 (7th Cir. 2016). Pretext is not established simply because the plaintiff denies the proffered reasons. The Seventh Circuit recently reiterated this notion when it stated: Shures contends on appeal that, because he denies all of the employer’s findings concerning poor performance, a jury trial is required to resolve the dispute. This misunderstands what is necessary to establish pretext. Most fired employees believe that they have unrecognized or underappreciated talents. But it does not matter what the employee believes; the question is what the employer believes. To establish pretext, the plaintiff must show that the employer does not believe its own explanation – that it is lying rather than just making an error. See, e.g., Petts v. Rockledge Furniture LLC, 534 F.3d 715, 726 (7th Cir. 2008); Bragg v. Munster Medical Research Foundation Inc., 58 F.4th 265, 271 (7th Cir. 2023). Shures v. Ameren Illinois Company, No. 23-2761, 2024 WL 1756338, at *1 (7th Cir. April 24, 2024). In the case at bar, Defendant placed Sisson on paid administrative leave the day after the altercation. As a result of this altercation, Officer Kinsey suffered visible injuries to his face, went to the health care unit immediately afterwards, and expressed his wishes to press charges against Sisson. There is no indication in the record that Officer Kinsey’s desire to press charges against Sisson was because he is African American. Rather, it was due to the physical altercation. Further, as to Defendant placing Sisson on paid administrative leave, there is no evidence that Defendant did so based on Sisson’s race. There is also no evidence to suggest that Defendant’s reasons for doing so were not based on anything other than Officer Kinsey’s physical injuries. In short, Sisson has not shown Defendant’s decision was based on a lie or dishonesty. Thus, as to Sisson’s claim that he was placed on paid administrative leave because of his race, the Court finds that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment. Similarly, there is no evidence that Defendant’s decision to suspend Sisson on June 30, 2018, was based on a lie or dishonesty held by the Defendant. Defendant contends that it suspended Sisson after the criminal charges were filed against him on May 22, 2018, and after the ERB’s finding that Sisson’s conduct on December 12, 2017, violated several employee rules. The Court also notes that the ERB’s recommendation for suspension was signed by Major Davis, an African American female, which weighs against Sisson’s claim. See, e.g., Menefee v. Dynamic Educational Systems, Inc., No. 07 C 6396, 2008 WL 4866016, at *3 n.3 (N.D. Ill. June 17, 2008) (stating that “there can be no compelling inference of discrimination when the decision-maker is in the same protected category as the plaintiff.”). Further, Sisson, without citing to the record, contends that Defendant’s investigation relied on inaccurate, false, or incomplete evidence, which thus undermines Defendant’s reasons for suspending him. Specifically, Sisson maintains that Sgt. Melvin made statements to the Grand Jury that were later contradicted by other witness testimony and physical evidence.8 Sisson also maintains that witnesses, Correctional Sergeant Rumph and Correctional Sergeant Swanson, demonstrated that he acted in self- 8 The record reflects that Sergeant Melvin is an Illinois State Police Investigator involved in Sisson’s criminal investigation. Sergeant Melvin is not employed by the IDOC. defense and that Kinsey initiated the physical confrontation by attempting to strike him with the radio.9 Sisson’s argument misses the mark. The reason Defendant suspended Sisson was because of the pending criminal charges against him. Once those pending criminal charges were dismissed, Defendant promptly retuned Sisson to work. Further, Sisson has not established that the investigation was unreliable. The Court has read Correctional Sergeant Swanson’s and Correctional Sergeant Rumph’s statements, and they do not establish definitively that Sisson acted in self-defense or that Kinsey was the aggressor as argued by Sisson. As stated previously, both men stated that they did not see how the altercation started. Simply put, Sisson failed to present evidence that his suspension was based on his race. Sisson’s case also falls short under the holistic evidence framework. This framework requires a court to determine whether all the relevant evidence “would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the plaintiff’s race . . . caused the discharge or other adverse employment action.” Ortiz, 834 F.3d at 765. A court must ask “whether the totality of the evidence shows discrimination, eschewing any framework of formula.” Igasaki v. Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, 988 F.3d 948, 958 (7th Cir. 2021). Relevant evidence includes smoking-gun evidence such as a defendant's “actual admission of discriminatory intent.” See Bagwe v. Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc., 811 F.3d 866, 879 (7th Cir. 2016) (citing Mullin v. Temco Machinery, Inc., 732 F.3d 772, 775 (7th Cir. 2013)). Circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the employer's stated reasons for suspending the plaintiff were pretextual, is also relevant. See Coleman v. Donahoe, 667 F.3d 835, 852 (7 Cir. 2012). As the Seventh Circuit made clear in Ortiz, all the “evidence belongs in a single pile and must be evaluated as a whole” to determine discriminatory intent. 834 F.3d at 766. The only evidence of race discrimination that Sisson identifies is that Officer Kinsey, a white male, was not investigated, charged with a crime, or suspended as he was. However, immediately after the incident, Officer Kinsey stated that he wanted to press charges against Sisson, and the police were called to investigate. The record does not reflect that Sisson pursued charges against Officer Kinsey. In the final analysis, when the evidence is considered “in a single pile,” which consists only of the fact that Sisson is a member of a protected class, no reasonable juror could find that he was suspended because of his race. Defendant is entitled to summary judgment. CONCLUSION Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 112). The Court FINDS in favor of Defendant Illinois Department of Corrections and against Plaintiff Alnando Sisson. Lastly, the Court DIRECTS the Clerk of the Court to enter judgment reflecting the same and close the case. IT IS SO ORDERED. Digitally signed by DATED: September 19, 2025. Attar 2.

Because he is proceeding in forma pauperis (“IFP”), Plaintiff’s complaint must be screened to protect potential defendants. Phillips v. Mashburn, 746 F.2d 782, 785 (11th Cir. 1984); Al-Amin v. Donald, 165 F. App’x 733, 736 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam). I. SCREENING OF THE COMPLAINT A. BACKGROUND Plaintiff names as Defendants: (1) Warden Brian Adams, (2) Cert Team Jackson, (3) Captain Michael Hartmeyer, (4) Case Manager Ms. Westin, (5) John Doe, Unknown IRT/Cobra Squad, (6) John Doe, Unknown IRT/Cobra Squad, and (7) Warden Cox. (Doc. no. 1, pp. 1, 4.) Taking all of Plaintiff’s factual allegations as true, as the Court must for purposes of the present screening, the facts are as follows. Plaintiff’s claims arise out of a series of events occurring in March and April 2021 at Smith State Prison. (Id. at 5-7, 9-13.) In early April 2021, Defendants Jackson and John Doe placed inmate Desmond Hill in Plaintiff’s cell while Plaintiff was naked “on strip cell.” (Id. at 5, 9.) Plaintiff informed Defendant Jackson that inmate Hill should be housed “with one of [h]is people/gang members” and not with Plaintiff because Plaintiff was “not affiliated” with a gang. (Id.) However, Defendant Jackson ignored Plaintiff’s request and placed inmate Hill, who was fully clothed, in Plaintiff’s cell. (Id.) The next day, inmate Hill tried to rape Plaintiff, causing Plaintiff to kill him in self-defense. (Id.) A few weeks prior to this incident, Defendant Hartmeyer had threatened to send an inmate to rape and kill Plaintiff. (Id.) In response, Plaintiff filed a “PREA claim” on his tablet against Defendant Hartmeyer and called the suicide hotline to report the threat. (Id. at 5, 10.) Plaintiff also told Counselor Madison about this threat and wrote a statement requesting protective custody, which he provided to the night shift lieutenant. (Id. at 5-6, 10.) Plaintiff believed “the guards” were going to send an inmate to rape and kill him because they previously “sent a hit at [him].” (Id. at 6, 10.) At an unknown time thereafter, Cert Barns and Defendant Hartmeyer moved Plaintiff to the strip cell despite Plaintiff’s requests for protective custody. (Id. at 6.) The strip cell had been recently “sprayed” without being cleaned out, yet they nonetheless placed Plaintiff inside. (Id.) When Plaintiff asked why he was moved to the strip cell, Defendant Hartmeyer told him he was being placed there because he called the suicide hotline. (Id.) Plaintiff then accused Defendant Hartmeyer of retaliation against him for filing a PREA statement about Defendant Hartmeyer’s threats. (Id.) Defendant Hartmeyer stated Defendant Westin told him to place Plaintiff in the strip Plaintiff later informed Counselor Dennis about the situation and clarified he did not call the suicide hotline because he was going to hurt himself, but rather because Defendant Hartmeyer had threatened him. (Id. at 7.) Counselor Dennis told Plaintiff he was under “mental health evaluation” and only Defendant Westin could take him off this status. (Id. at 7, 10.) However, Defendant Westin actually placed Plaintiff in the strip cell “as a favor” to Defendant Hartmeyer. (Id.) Plaintiff remained in the strip cell, which was freezing cold, for three weeks. (Id. at 7.) At an unknown point, Plaintiff was let out of the strip cell and “got into it with the orderly” because the orderly placed something in Plaintiff’s food. (Id. at 11.) Plaintiff threw “the tray milk and piss on the orderly,” which caused another officer to get hit. (Id.) In response to the incident, Defendant John Doe appeared and punched Plaintiff. (Id. at 7, 11.) During the altercation, Defendant John Doe cut Plaintiff’s elbow with a razor blade. (Id.) Plaintiff was then placed back in the strip cell, but because he was bleeding, he was thereafter taken to the medical department. (Id. at 11.) However, because the cut was deep, Plaintiff received seven to nine stitches as treatment for this injury at a “freeworld hospital.” (Id. at 7, 12.) After Plaintiff returned to Smith State Prison, someone had “blowed the light in [his] cell,” cut off the water, and taken his belongings. (Id.) Defendant Hartmeyer instructed another officer to take Plaintiff back to the strip cell despite Plaintiff’s protests that he had not done anything. (Id. at 7, 12.) Plaintiff was placed back in the strip cell without access to water. (Id.) Every day Plaintiff saw Defendant Adams and Cox, he informed them about what was going on, yet they completely disregarded Plaintiff’s complaints. (Id. at 8, 13.) Plaintiff seeks monetary and equitable relief. (Id. at 8.) On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint in Coast v. Adams, et al., CV 623- 029, doc. no. 5 (S.D. Ga. Apr. 26, 2023) (“CV 623-029”), asserting claims against Defendants: (1) Tyrone Oliver, (5) Ms. Westin, (6) Unknown Officer – IRT/Cobra Squad, (7) Warden Cox, (8) Officer Witfield, and (9) Officer Joseph Barnes. Plaintiff’s amended complaint contained various allegations concerning his PREA claim against Defendant Hartmeyer based on Defendant Hartmeyer’s threats to have another inmate rape and kill Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s call to the suicide hotline, his placement in the strip cell as retaliation, being cut by a razor blade by an unknown officer, his return from the hospital and subsequent placement in strip cell without water, Defendant Jackson placing inmate Hill in the cell with Plaintiff, and Plaintiff’s killing of inmate Hill in self-defense after the attempted rape. Id., pp. 4-5, 12-14. On July 20, 2023, the Court screened Plaintiff’s amended complaint and ordered service of process for the retaliation claim against Defendant Hartmeyer. Id., doc. nos. 10-12. The Court recommended the remaining Defendants, as well as the failure to protect claim and any official capacity claim for monetary damages against Defendant Hartmeyer, be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Id., doc. no. 10. On August 14, 2023, United States District Judge J. Randal Hall adopted the Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation (“R&R”). Id., doc. no. 15. On June 17, 2024, Defendant Hartmeyer filed a motion for summary judgment. Id., doc. nos. 39-42. On July 25, 2024, the Court recommended Defendant Hartmeyer’s motion be granted because the record evidence and undisputed facts revealed no causal connection between the protected activities – the PREA complaint and suicide hotline call – and retaliatory action. Id., doc. no. 43-1. On August 29, 2024, Judge Hall adopted the R&R, and a final judgment was entered in favor of Defendant Hartmeyer. Id., doc. nos. 46-47. About 284 days later, Plaintiff filed this instant suit containing the same claims as CV 623-029. (See generally doc. no. 1.) B. DISCUSSION 1. Legal Standard for Screening to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or if it seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune to such relief. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(b). A claim is frivolous if it “lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.” Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 325 (1989). “Failure to state a claim under § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is governed by the same standard as dismissal for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).” Wilkerson v. H & S, Inc., 366 F. App’x 49, 51 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (citing Mitchell v. Farcass, 112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir. 1997)). To avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the allegations in the complaint must “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). That is, “[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. While Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not require detailed factual allegations, “it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. A complaint is insufficient if it “offers ‘labels and conclusions’ or ‘a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action,’” or if it “tenders ‘naked assertions’ devoid of ‘further factual enhancement.’” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 557). In short, the complaint must provide a “‘plain statement’ possess[ing] enough heft to ‘sho[w] that the pleader is entitled to relief.’” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Finally, the Court affords a liberal construction to a pro se litigant’s pleadings, holding them to a more lenient standard than those drafted by an attorney. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007); Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972). However, this liberal construction F.3d 1314, 1320 (11th Cir. 2006). 2. Plaintiff’s Suit is Barred by Claim Preclusion “The doctrine of claim preclusion (or res judicata) bars the parties to an action from relitigating matters that were or could have been litigated in an earlier suit.” Shurick v. Boeing Co., 623 F.3d 1114, 1116 (11th Cir. 2010). For the doctrine to apply, four elements must be met: “(1) a court of competent jurisdiction has (2) rendered a final judgment on the merits in another case involving (3) the same parties and (4) the same cause of action.” Id. at 1116-17. Additionally, the party must have had “a full and fair opportunity to litigate the claims and issues settled in a previous suit.” Morris v. May, 570 F. App’x 903, 905 (11th Cir. 2014). To determine whether the causes of action are the same, courts look to the factual issues in the second lawsuit and compare them to the first lawsuit, and if the case arises out of the same nucleus of operative fact, then the “two cases are really the same.” Id. at 906. The facts in the present case are precisely the same as Plaintiff alleged in CV 623-029. See CV 623-029, doc. no. 5, pp. 4-5, 12-15. Aside from the deletion of Defendants Tryone Oliver, Officer Witfield, and Joseph Barnes and the addition of a second John Doe, Unknown IRT/Cobra Squad Defendant, the Defendants alleged in the instant case mirror the named defendants in his other case. See id.; (doc. no. 1.) Moreover, the claims arise from the same common nucleus of operative fact. See, e.g., Simmons v. Coffee Co., No. 5:14-cv-19, 2014 WL 6455137, at *4 (S.D. Ga. Nov. 13, 2014) (“Plaintiff asserts the same causes of action against these Defendants[] because the two cases arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact—Plaintiff’s imprisonment following his arrest and the property dispute.”). Specifically, in both cases, Plaintiff claims Defendant Hartmeyer threatened to have another inmate rape and kill him, leading Plaintiff to submit a PREA complaint and call the suicide hotline. CV 623-029, doc. retaliation, was injured by a razor blade, and thereafter killed another inmate in self-defense after Defendant Jackson placed this inmate in the strip cell. See id. In CV 623-029, the Court first screened Plaintiff’s amended complaint, ordered service on Defendant Hartmeyer for the retaliation claim, and dismissed the remaining defendants and claims for failure to state a claim. CV 623-029, doc. nos. 10-12. Later, the Court granted the Defendant Hartmeyer’s motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s retaliation claim. Id., doc. no. 46. Thus, Plaintiff’s claims were all “adjudication[s] on the merits for res judicata purposes.” Harmon v. Webster, 263 F. App’x 844, 845 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). In sum, Plaintiff was given a full and fair opportunity to litigate his claims and cannot now attempt to re-litigate the claims. Morris, 570 F. App’x at 905. 3. Plaintiff’s Claims Are Time-Barred Even if Plaintiff’s case was not barred by claim preclusion, Plaintiff’s claims are nevertheless time-barred. Plaintiff’s claims are subject to dismissal under the statute of limitations applicable in Georgia. State law controls the length of the statute of limitations period in § 1983 actions. Chapman v. Dunn, 129 F.4th 1307, 1315 (11th Cir. 2025); Abreu- Velez v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 248 F. App’x 116, 117 (11th Cir. 2007) (per curiam). In Georgia, such claims for injuries to the person must be brought within two years of their accrual. Richards v. Cobb Cnty., Ga., 487 F. App’x 556, 557 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam); Williams v. City of Atlanta, 794 F.2d 624, 626 (11th Cir. 1986); O.C.G.A. § 9-3-33. Although state law determines the applicable statute of limitations period for claims under § 1983, federal law determines the date of accrual. See Chapman, 129 F.4th at 1315 (citing Rozar v. Mullis, 85 F.3d 556, 561 (11th Cir. 1996)). Under § 1983, a claim accrues “once the plaintiff knows or should know ‘the injury that forms the basis of [his] complaint,’ as well as (per curiam)); see also Brown v. Ga. Bd. of Pardons & Paroles, 335 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir. 2003) (per curiam). Here, Plaintiff dated his complaint May 28, 2025, and the Court received it for filing on June 9, 2025. (See doc. no. 1.) However, Plaintiffs alleged claims took place between March 2021 and April 2021.! (Id. at 5-7, 9-13.) Therefore, the facts which would support a cause of action were apparent to Plaintiff by at least April 2021, thus, they are outside of the two-year statute of limitations period and subject to dismissal. IL. CONCLUSION For the reasons set forth above, the Court REPORTS and RECOMMENDS Plaintiff’ □ complaint be DISMISSED for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and this civil action be CLOSED. SO REPORTED and RECOMMENDED this 19th day of August, 2025, at Augusta, Georgia. BRIAN EK. 2 UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA ' Plaintiff provides he killed the other inmate in self-defense on April 7 or 8, 2021. (Doc. no. 1, pp. 5, 9.) He then describes the series of events leading up to this incident, though he does not supply any exact dates. (See generally id.) In the form question asking when the alleged events took place, Plaintiff wrote “2021 March [and] April.” (Id. at 5.) Based on the foregoing, the lack of exact dates need not delay the Court because April 8, 2021, the latest date on which Plaintiff’s claims occurred, was well over two years ago and is thus barred by the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs claims about events preceding this date are likewise time-barred.\", '_score': 0.30664604902267456}, {'title': 'Untitled', 'court': '', 'date_filed': datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), 'url': 'https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/10674662/ambler-v-flathead-conservation-district/', 'text': 'IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA MISSOULA DIVISION JOHN AMBLER and STACY AMBLER, CV 23-151-M-KLD Plaintiffs, ORDER vs. FLATHEAD CONSERVATION DISTRICT, Defendant. and FRIENDS OF MONTANA STREAMS AND RIVERS, Defendant-Intervenor This matter comes before the court on Plaintiffs John and Stacy Ambler’s Motion for Attorney Fees (Doc. 16). The issues are fully briefed and ripe for ruling. I. Background1 This case involves a dispute over the Flathead Conservation District’s (“FCD”) assertion of jurisdiction over property owned by Plaintiffs John and Stacy Ambler 1 Unless otherwise noted, the factual background is taken from the Court’s Order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment (Doc. 51). within Glacier National Park in Flathead County, Montana. FCD, which is a governmental subdivision of the State of Montana, sought to enforce the Montana Natural Streambed and Land Preservation Act of 1975 (“Streambed Act”) on the Amblers’ property, which is a privately owned parcel within the boundaries of Glacier National Park. The Amblers built a home on the bank of McDonald Creek without first seeking a 310 permit, and FCD advised Amblers that they would have to remove the home, in addition to applying for and obtaining a 310 permit before removing the structure. The Amblers brought this declaratory judgment action, seeking a ruling establishing that FCD lacked jurisdiction to enforce the Streambed Act on private property within the boundary of Glacier National Park and that the Streambed Act does not apply to their property. At an early stage of the litigation, Friends of Montana Streams and Rivers (“FMSR”) was granted permission to intervene. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the Court ultimately found that FCD lacked jurisdiction to enforce the Streambed Act on the Ambler property because Montana had previously ceded exclusive jurisdiction over all land within the boundaries of Glacier National Park to the federal government, including private inholdings within those boundaries. The Amblers move the Court for an award of attorney fees, seeking a total of $80,986.50 in fees, which represents reimbursement for 309.45 hours of work. (Doc. 55 at 15). Their request is supported by the affidavits of JR Casillas, Jarred Hunsaker, Quenton Hegel, and Trent Baker, all of whom performed work on this case on behalf of the Amblers. (Docs. 56-59). FCD and FMSR both oppose the motion for fees, and FMSR additionally asserts that if fees are awarded, the award as to FMSR should be reduced to reflect its limited involvement as Intervenor. However, as the Amblers have clarified that they are seeking fees only from FCD, the Court will not address FMSR’s arguments. (Doc. 69 at 2). Although FCD challenges the Amblers’ entitlement to fees, it does not challenge the reasonableness of the fees sought by them. II. Discussion Where, as here, a party seeks attorney fees for a diversity action brought in federal court under the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, the court may award fees if doing so “would be in accord with state law.” Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. Davis, 689 F.Supp. 1028, 1029 (D. Mont. 1988). Accordingly, the Court looks to Montana law to determine if the Amblers are entitled to an award of attorney fees. Montana generally follows the American Rule, which holds that “absent a specific statutory or contractual provision, a prevailing party generally is not entitled to recovery of its attorneys’ fees in prosecuting or defending the action.” West. Tradition P’ship. v. Atty. General of State, 291 P.3d 545, 548 (Mont. 2012) (citations omitted). While there are equitable exceptions to the American Rule, they are construed narrowly “to ensure they do not overtake the rule.” Davis v. Jefferson Co. Election Office, 412 P.3d 1048, 1051 (Mont. 2018) (citation omitted). One exception recognized by Montana is when there is a statutory basis for an attorney fee award, which is the exception under which the Amblers request fees. The Amblers raise two statutory avenues for recovery of fees: Montana Code Annotated §§ 27-8-313 and 25-10-711(1). The Court will discuss each in turn. A. Montana Code Annotated § 25-10-711(1) A prevailing party in a civil action with a political subdivision of the state may be awarded reasonable attorney fees if “the court finds that the claim or defense of the state, political subdivision, or agency that brought or defended the action was frivolous or pursued in bad faith.” Mont. Code Ann. § 25-10-711(1)(b). “A claim or defense is frivolous or in bad faith ‘when it is “outside the bounds of legitimate argument on a substantial issue on which there is a bona fide difference of opinion.”’” West. Tradition P’ship, 291 P.3d at 548 (citations omitted). However, it is not necessarily bad faith or frivolous simply because the argument is incorrect. Davis, 412 P.3d at 1053. Relying on the advice and assessment of counsel can be a factor in determining whether a party has pursued a claim or defended a claim in bad faith. Davis, 412 P.3d at 1053. Raising a legitimate argument on a controlling question of law is not frivolous or bad faith. Slack v. Landmark Co., 362 Mont. 514, 521 (Mont. 2011). The Amblers argue FCD “had no legitimate jurisdictional arguments” in light of Macomber v. Bose, 401 F.2d 545 (9th Cir. 1968), in which the Court held Montana had ceded, and the United States accepted, dominion over privately owned land within Glacier Park. In disagreeing with this conclusion, FCD argues that Macomber discussed only federal judicial jurisdiction and was thus inapposite to the specific issue in the case, and that Macomber failed to consider the proper statutory framework. FCD asserts the Macomber case is not legally sound based on the analysis of applicable statutes in that case, and that it was reasonable for FCD to challenge the jurisdictional issue. FMSR additionally argued in the summary judgment briefing, and FCD agreed, that this District’s decision in Howard v. Todd, 2022 WL 1044972 (D. Mont. Apr. 7, 2022) supported the contention that Montana law could validly be applied to privately owned inholdings within Glacier Park. Ultimately, the Court did not agree with FCD’s contentions as to the application of state law to privately owned inholdings, but the Court cannot say that FCD’s arguments to the contrary were outside the bounds of legitimate argument on the ultimate issue, namely whether FCD had jurisdiction to enforce the Streambed Act on the Ambler property. While with the hindsight of the Court’s conclusion it may seem so, the Amblers’ ultimate victory came only after significant briefing, oral argument, and a thorough analysis of several complicated and seemingly incongruous legal theories. The Amblers argue that FCD’s attorney, during the administrative process, incorrectly analyzed the jurisdictional issue and then failed to adequately research further. However, FCD’s reliance on its attorney’s conclusions certainly cannot be bad faith, and even though FCD did not prevail, the Court cannot say that FCD’s legal strategy was outside the bounds of legitimate argument: FCD had a bona fide disagreement with an issue of law, and raised that issue with the Court. For these reasons, the Court finds that Mont. Code Ann. § 25- 10-711(1)(b) is not a basis for an award of attorney fees. B. Montana Code Annotated § 27-8-313 The Amblers’ second potential avenue for recovery of attorney fees is Montana Code Annotated § 27-8-313, which permits supplemental relief to a prevailing party in a declaratory judgment act case whenever “necessary or proper.” When determining whether an award of attorney fees is appropriate, “[t]he threshold consideration . . . is whether equitable considerations support the award.” Davis, 412 P.3d at 1052 (citations omitted). If the equities do support an award, the Court applies the “tangible parameters test” to decide if fees are necessary or proper. Davis, 412 P.3d at 1052 (citation omitted). The tangible parameters test asks “whether (1) the defendant possesses what the plaintiff sought in the declaratory relief action; (2) it is necessary to seek a declaration showing the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief sought; and (3) the declaratory relief sought was necessary to change the status quo.” Town of Kevin v. N. Central Mont. Reg. Water Auth., 553 P.3d 392, 396 (Mont. 2024). If a party does not pass the threshold of showing that equity supports an attorney fee award, the court need not consider the tangible parameters test. Davis, 412 P.3d at 1054. One equitable consideration courts examine is “whether the parties are similarly situated.” City of Helena v. Svee, 339 P.3d 32, 37 (Mont. 2014). In Svee, the Svees had been notified by their homeowner’s insurer that their policy would be canceled unless their roof was repaired. Svee, 339 P.3d at 34. The City of Helena (“the City”) had previously enacted a zoning ordinance that governed roof repairs in the zoning district in which the Svees lived, but the Svees’ roof repair project did not comply with the ordinance, as it was cost-prohibitive for them. Svee, 339 P.3d at 33-34. The City got wind of the project, issued a stop-work notice, filed criminal charges against the Svees, and filed a six-count civil complaint against them. Svee, 339 P.3d at 34. The Svees filed a counter-declaratory judgment action against the City, seeking a determination that the ordinance was invalid, and shortly thereafter, the City dropped the criminal charges. Svee, 339 P.3d at 34. The district court invalidated the ordinance, but denied the Svees’ motion for attorney fees. Svee, 339 P.3d at 34. On appeal, the Court noted that while it had previously declined to award fees in other cases, the particular facts of that case warranted an equitable fee award: The case here is distinguishable from those noted above in that the parties here are clearly not similarly situated or on equal footing. The Svees sought to accomplish a low-cost repair of their roof in response to a notice from their insurance company about cancellation of their coverage. By so doing, they were named as defendants in both criminal and civil actions filed by the municipal government, in comparison to whom they had significantly less resources to litigate the alleged violation of the ordinance. As such, the equitable threshold is met. Svee, 339 P.3d at 37-38. Because the Svees satisfied both the threshold equitable consideration, as well as the tangible parameters test, the Court awarded them fees. Svee, 339 P.3d at 39. The Amblers argue Svee is analogous to the case at hand because FCD is a governmental entity, as is the City of Helena, and the Amblers are private parties seeking to vindicate rights, as were the Svees. If the Amblers are correct, Svee stands for the proposition that any time a private party prevails in a declaratory judgment action with the government, it automatically satisfies the equities and tangible parameters test. The Montana Supreme Court has clarified that Svee did not change or dilute the law, but “merely represents one of the rare instances in which equitable considerations necessitated an award.” Mont. Immigration Justice Alliance v. Bullock, 371 P.3d 430, 445 (Mont. 2016). The Court noted that “[c]entral to our award of attorney fees in Svee was the fact that the Svees were named as defendants in both criminal and civil actions brought by the City of Helena.” Mont. Immigration Justice Alliance, 371 P.3d at 445. Here, by contrast, while the Amblers were required to challenge FCD’s assertion of jurisdiction to ultimately prevail, they did not face criminal charges which were only dropped after seeking a declaratory ruling. FCD, which operates through a volunteer board of supervisors, is tasked with administering the Streambed Act. (Doc. 14 at 3). While FCD, as part of administering the Streambed Act, can require compliance with the Act, including the removal of a non-compliant structure, it cannot criminally charge and did not do so in this case. The Amblers argue that the fact they incurred legal expenses in filing and prosecuting this declaratory judgment action supports an award of attorney fees, and also assert FCD “was far more sophisticated than the Amblers with respect to the question of jurisdiction at issue in each stage of this dispute.” (Doc. 55 at 9-10). The latter argument undercuts Amblers’ contention that FCD did not adequately research or understand the law regarding jurisdiction over privately-owned inholdings, and does not support a finding that the equities demand an award of attorney fees. As to the former, simply incurring legal fees in a dispute with a governmental entity is not “one of the rare instances in which equitable considerations” dictate an award. If that were the case, there would be no need to consider equity: it would simply be a “loser pays” system. Here, FCD genuinely, albeit incorrectly, believed it had jurisdiction to enforce the Streambed Act on private property located within the boundaries of Glacier National Park. The Amblers, who built a home on the banks of McDonald Creek, challenged that determination and ultimately prevailed. Under these circumstances, equity does not support an award of attorney fees. II. Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, IT IS ORDERED that Amblers’ motion for attorney fees (Doc. 54) is DENIED. DATED this 18th day of September, 2025.

MEMORADUM AND Plaintiff, ORDER 24 CV 360 (RPK) (CLP) -against- BRADLEY PIERRE, et al., Defendants. ------------------------------------------------------------X On January 17, 2024, plaintiff American Transit Insurance Company (“American Transit” or “plaintiff”) commenced this action against defendants Bradley Pierre (“Pierre”), Marvin Moy, M.D., Rutland Medical P.C. (“Rutland”), William A. Weiner, D.O., Nexray Medical Imaging, P.C., d/b/a Soul Radiology Medical Imaging (“Nexray”), and John Does 1-15, pursuant to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. § 1961, seeking damages and a Declaratory Judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, based on defendants’ alleged illegal scheme to defraud plaintiff by collecting payments on numerous non- compensable, false, inflated and fraudulent No-Fault insurance claims. (“Compl.”). Plaintiff also alleges claims based on violations of N.Y. Public Health Law § 238(a), common law fraud, and unjust enrichment. (Id.) Currently pending before this Court is American Transit’s Motion to compel Pierre to produce documents in response to a subpoena duces tecum dated August 5, 2024. BACKGROUND Plaintiff American Transit served a non-party subpoena duces tecum to defendant Pierre at FCI Lewisberg, where Pierre is serving his sentence for a related criminal matter. The subpoena required Pierre’s response by September 6, 2024. (See Status Report1 at 2). Pierre did not respond to the subpoena. Instead, at a status conference on October 28, 2024, the Court Ordered Pierre to respond to the subpoena by November 12, 2024. (See ECF No. 93 at 12:2– 13:9). On November 14, 2024, the Court granted an extension to that deadline until December 2, 2024 and, in doing so, ruled that “all objections to the subpoena’s requests are deemed waived.” (ECF No. 97 at 3). On December 2, 2024, Pierre responded to the subpoena. (See Status Report at 2). However, he responded to each request with the same blanket objection: “CLIENT asserts his rights to invoke the Fifth Amendment and specifically his right against self-incrimination” (See Pl.’s Resp., Ex. A); he produced no documents. On December 11, 2024, the Court Ordered Pierre to provide the Court with legal authority in support of his blanket Fifth Amendment objections by January 10, 2025, and permitted plaintiff to submit a response by January 17, 2025. (Electronic Order, 12/11/2024). On January 16, 2025, Pierre submitted a letter to the Court (ECF No. 143) directing it to three cases—Mitchell v. United States, 526 U.S. 314 (1999); United States v. Lumpkin, 192 F.3d 280 (2d Cir. 1992); and United States v. Bahadar, 954 F.2d 821 (2d Cir. 1999)—presumably for their shared proposition that a guilty plea does not affect a defendant’s ability to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Plaintiff filed its response on January 17, 2025, pointing out that Pierre’s legal authority was untimely and 1 References to “Status Report” refer to the status report filed by American Transit on December 6, 2024 (ECF No. 105). References to “Pl.’s Resp.” refer to plaintiff’s letter filed on January 17, 2025 (ECF No. 145) in response to defendant’s letter containing the legal authority for its Fifth Amendment objections. reiterating its argument that Pierre’s Fifth Amendment objections were “ineffective.” (See generally Pl.’s Resp.). Without leave, Pierre filed a reply to plaintiff’s response, underlining his belief that he had not waived his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. (See ECF No. 148). On February 3, 2025, plaintiff moved to strike Pierre’s reply because it was “unauthorized and non-responsive to the December 11, 2024 Order of the Court.” (See generally ECF No. 149). Meanwhile, defendant Pierre has been in default by failing to file an Answer or otherwise respond to the underlying Complaint in this action. On April 9, 2024, plaintiff moved for default judgment against Pierre (ECF No. 37), and the Court ordered that Pierre “either arrange with plaintiff to pay [the] costs of [a] default judgment motion or file [a] motion to vacate.” (Minute entry, dated June 13, 2024). On July 26, 2024, Pierre moved to vacate the default (ECF No. 73), and on August 27, 2024, this Court recommended that the district court grant the motion to vacate and order Pierre to pay a reasonable portion of plaintiff’s attorney’s fees. (ECF No. 77). The district court adopted the report and recommendation on March 19, 2025, and directed plaintiff to submit documentation to support the fee award. (ECF No. 153). On August 25, 2025, this Court issued a Report, recommending that the district court grant plaintiff’s fee application and order Pierre to pay the plaintiff’s fees by September 9, 2025. (ECF No. 187). Pierre has not paid those fees and therefore remains in default. (See ECF No. 194). DISCUSSION A. Waiver A party’s Fifth Amendment privilege is “neither absolute nor self-executing; it may be affirmatively waived or lost if not asserted in a timely fashion.” In re Gorsoan Ltd., No. 17 CV 5812, 2020 WL 3172777, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 15, 2020) (quotations and alterations omitted) (quoting Maness v. Meyers, 419 U.S. 449, 466 (1975)). “[L]itigation conduct short of a ‘knowing and intelligent waiver,’ ” including the failure to timely assert the privilege in response to a subpoena, may waive a party’s Fifth Amendment privilege. In re DG Acquisition Corp., 151 F.3d 75, 80–81 (2d Cir. 1998) (holding that “a person responding to a subpoena should at least assert any privileges within…14 days”) (quoting Garner v. United States, 424 U.S. 648, 654 n. 9 (1976)). See also Parlin Funds LLC v. Gilliams, No. 11 CV 2534, 2012 WL 5265554, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 15, 2012) (denying Fifth Amendment privilege objection because the court’s previous order held that any objections to discovery demands were waived “by virtue of defendants’ prolonged unexcused defaults”). Although the failure to object to a subpoena in a timely fashion does not necessarily waive a party’s Fifth Amendment privilege, see SPV-LS, LLS v. Herbst, No. 16 MC 187, 2016 WL 8711738, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 3, 2016), the decision over whether unreasonable delay waived the privilege is left to the trial court’s discretion. In re Gorsoan Ltd., 2020 WL 3172777, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 15, 2020) (citing In re DG Acquisition Corp., 151 F.3d at 82)). Here, Pierre’s failure to object was more than mere inaction—he was in complete default of his obligations to comply with the subpoena. It was not until the Court held a status conference and plaintiff stated on the record that Pierre was in default of his discovery obligations that defendant’s counsel even acknowledged the subpoena. (See ECF No. 93 at 4:4- 9). In fact, Pierre’s counsel refused service of the subpoena and then told the Court that the subpoena was never served upon them. (See ECF No. 93 at 8:11-19 (where plaintiff’s counsel represented to the Court that they “subpoenaed [Pierre] where he [was] confined at prison. The reason we had to do that is because we reached out to [Pierre’s attorney] and requested, will you accept service for your client, Mr. Pierre, which they refused”). This claim by Pierre’s counsel denying service of the subpoena “smacks of procedural gamesmanship and dilatory tactics,” warranting a finding of waiver. See In re Gorsoan Ltd., 2020 WL 3172777, at *7 (citation omitted). Although this Court granted an extension of time for Pierre to respond, Pierre’s failure to respond to the subpoena for over two months and his failure to timely request an extension of time prompted the Court to rule on November 14, 2024 that “all objections to the subpoena’s requests are deemed waived.” (ECF No. 97 at 3). B. Fifth Amendment Privilege Although the Court has previously found all objections waived, the Court nonetheless has examined plaintiff’s claim of self-incrimination. Under the Fifth Amendment, no person “shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “The burden of establishing entitlement to the Fifth Amendment privilege rests with the person asserting it.” Krape v. PDK Labs, Inc., No. 02 CV 3440, 2004 WL 831137, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 19, 2004) (citing Estate of Fisher v. C.I.R., 905 F.2d 645, 649–50 (2d Cir. 1990)). To meet this burden, the party asserting the privilege must show that the documents sought would “furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute.” Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486 (1951). The witness must make a detailed showing because “his say-so does not of itself establish that hazard of incrimination.” Id. Thus, a blanket assertion of the privilege does not satisfy this burden. Cadlerock Joint Venture, L.P. v. MacPherson, No. 09 CV 9970, 2011 WL 1795312, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2011); New York ex rel. Khurana v. Spherion Corp., 511 F. Supp. 3d 455, 463 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2021) (holding that “[i]t is well established that ‘blanket assertion[s]’ of the Fifth Amendment privilege are impermissible.”) (citing United States v, Bowe, 698 F.2d 560, 566 (2d Cir. 1983)). Rather, the proper procedure is for the witness to make an individualized determination for each discovery request and respond to those for which he is able to respond without risking self-incrimination. Krape v. PDK Labs, Inc., 2004 WL 831137, at *4. For documents to fall under the protections of the Fifth Amendment, they must be “ ‘testimonial, incriminating, and compelled.’ ” Government Emps. Ins. Co. v. Kalitenko, No. 22 CV 3804, 2023 WL 112803, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 5, 2023) (quoting Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt Cnty., 542 U.S. 177, 189 (2004)); Slavin v. Artus, No. 05 CV 0870, 2010 WL 185108, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2010). The Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to business records or to records whose creation is required by law. See Braswell v. United States, 487 U.S. 99, 102 (1988) (holding that the contents of subpoenaed business records are not privileged); In re Two Grand Jury Subpoenae Duces Tecum Dated Aug. 21, 1985, 793 F.2d 69, 73 (2d Cir. 1986); Government Emps. Ins. Co. v. Kalitenko, 2023 WL 112803, at *3. Nor does the privilege protect the content of business or personal records which are voluntarily prepared. United States v. Bedell & Co., No. 06 CV 0342, 2006 WL 3813792, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 30, 2006). See Government Emps. Ins. Co. v. Kalitenko, 2023 WL 112803, at *4 (holding that the contents of voluntarily prepared records “are not privileged unless the subpoenaed individual is compelled to restate, repeat, or affirm the contents’ truth”) (quotation omitted). Additionally, “the Fifth Amendment does not protect the contents of an individual’s business records in his own possession” because these voluntarily prepared documents “cannot be said to contain compelled testimonial evidence in and of themselves.” In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, 1992, 1 F.3d 87, 92 (2d Cir. 1993) (citing United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605, 610, 612 n. 9 (1984)) (quotation omitted). Thus, a witness cannot claim the privilege over the contents of documents demanded. Id. (citing Baltimore Dep’t of Soc. Servs. v. Bouknight¸493 U.S. 549, 554–55 (1990)). “[B]ooks, invoices, bank records, deposit slips, cancelled checks, and any other record of a doctor’s business,” for example, “are normally not entitled to any protection on the basis of their contents.” United States v. Fox, 549 F. Supp. 1362, 1366 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). However, the mere act of producing documents may be testimonial in nature, and a witness may resist such production if doing so would be self-incriminating. In re Grand Jury Subpoena Issued June 18, 2009, 593 F.3d 155, 157 (2d Cir. 2010). This ‘act of production doctrine’ applies when the act of production itself “was (1) compelled, (2) testimonial, and (3) incriminating, in that compliance was the equivalent of forced testimony as to the existence, unlawful possession, and/or authenticity of the documents, as well as a belief that the produced documents matched those requested by the subpoena.” United States v. Gendreau, No. 12 MC 303, 2014 WL 464754, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2014) (quoting In re Three Grand Jury Subpoenas Duces Tecum Dated Jan. 29, 1999, 191 F.3d 73, 176 (2d Cir.1999)). The act of production doctrine is not without exception. Documents required to be kept by law or regulation are not covered by the doctrine. Ashkenazi as Tr. of Halpert Alexander Tr. v. Lincoln Nat’l Life Ins. Co., No. 08 CV 3235, 2010 WL 11623469, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 27, 2010). “Since the law requires that these records be maintained, they acquire a certain ‘public aspect’ and an individual ‘admits little of significance by producing them.’ ” Id. (quoting In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Served Upon Randall Underhill, 781 F.2d 64, 70 (6th Cir. 1986). To be considered a required record, a document must satisfy a three-part test: “(1) it must be legally required for a regulatory purpose, (2) it must be of a kind that the regulated party customarily keeps, and (3) it must have assumed ‘public aspects’ which render it analogous to public documents.” Id. Courts have already held that the required records exception applies to tax filings, In re Doe, 711 F.2d 1187, 1191 (1983), and healthcare providers’ patient files. In re Doe, 97 F.R.D. 640, 641–43 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). The act of production doctrine also does not apply where the existence and location of subpoenaed documents can be demonstrated with “reasonable particularity.” In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, 1992, 1 F.3d at 93 (2d Cir. 1993). The existence and location of a subpoenaed document is a “foregone conclusion[]” if it has already been produced in another action. See Id. See also Benthos Master Fund, Ltd. v. Etra, No. 20 CV 3384, 2023 WL 4350594, at *10–11 (S.D.N.Y. July 5, 2023) (holding that witness has not established a risk of prosecution over documents and information he has already voluntarily produced); In re Gorsoan, No. 17 CV 5912, 2020 WL 6891520, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 23, 2020) (finding no increased risk of prosecution where witness “has already produced thousands of additional documents…many of which cover the same subject matter” as the discovery request). Defendant Pierre’s invocation of the Fifth Amendment here is faulty for several reasons. First, Pierre has made the same blanket objection to each of the eighty subpoena requests. As discussed above, this is insufficient. Infra at 5–6. See Cadlerock Joint Venture, L.P. v. MacPherson, 2011 WL 1795312, at *2 (holding that “[t]he simple expedient of repeating the same objection over and over again is no less a blanket assertion of the privilege than a single assertion of the privilege in response to all the document requests”). Second, the subpoena seeks personal and business records that do not fall under the protection of the Fifth Amendment, such as employment agreements, providers’ medical records, books and bank accounts, cancelled checks, and other business records. (See generally Pl.’s Resp., Ex. A). Third, many of the documents sought are required records and fall outside of the reach of the Fifth Amendment. Finally, to the extent the subpoena seeks documents already produced in Pierre’s related criminal proceeding, he cannot claim the privilege. C. Contempt Plaintiff asks this Court to hold defendant Pierre in contempt for his failure to respond to its subpoena. (Pl.’s Resp. at 3). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(e) provides that “[f]ailure by any person without adequate excuse to obey a subpoena served upon that person may be deemed a contempt of the court from which the subpoena issued.” Defiance of a subpoena exposes the defiant witness to sanctions, but “contempt should be very sparingly applied.” Sterling Nat’l Bank v. A-1 Hotels, Int’l, Inc., No. 00 CV 7352, 2004 WL 1418201, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 23, 2004). The Court may hold a witness in civil contempt if “(1) the order he failed to comply with was clear and unambiguous, (2) the proof of noncompliance is clear and convincing, and (3) the party has not diligently attempted in a reasonable manner to comply.” Hernandez v. Sub Ents. Inc., No. 21 CV 1874, 2023 WL 2390543, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 7, 2023). All three requirements are met here to hold Pierre in contempt. The Court ordered Pierre to respond to the subpoena within two weeks of the October 28, 2024 status conference (ECF No. 93 at 12:2–13:9), and granted an extension “until December 2, 2024 to produce documents,” but warned that “all objections to the subpoena’s requests are deemed waived.” (ECF No. 97 at 3). These directives are definite and unambiguously direct Pierre to the conduct required by the Court’s orders. See Leser v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n, No. 09 CV 2362, 2011 WL 1004708, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2011) (holding that “a clear and unambiguous order is one specific and definite enough to apprise those within its scope of the conduct that is being proscribed “) (citing Medallic Art Co. v. Novus Mktg., No. 99 CV 502, 2003 WL 22053130, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 2, 2003)). It is also certain that a violation occurred and Pierre made no reasonable or diligent attempt to comply. The original subpoena was due on September 6, 2024 (see Status Report at 2), but Pierre did not even acknowledge the subpoena until the Court’s status conference on October 28, 2024. (See ECF No. 93 at 12:2–13:9). Moreover, Pierre’s counsel refused to accept service of the subpoena. (ECF No. 93 at 8:11-19). Counsel’s conduct is thus beyond a mere lack of reasonable diligence required to avoid contempt. See Leser v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n, 2011 WL 1004708, at *10 (holding that “there can be no finding of contempt if it has been shown that the alleged contemnor has been reasonably diligent and energetic in attempting to accomplish what was ordered”) (quotation omitted); Hernandez v. Sub Ents., Inc., 2023 WL 2390543, at *4 (finding that a witness was “not reasonably diligent” where he “consistently failed to comply with [a discovery] Order” and “has not made any productions”). Pierre also has no “adequate excuse” for not responding to the subpoena. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(e). In addition to its attempt to serve counsel, plaintiff served defendant Pierre directly at FCI Lewisberg, where he is serving a sentence for his related criminal conviction. (ECF No. 93 at 8:11-19). There is no dispute that Pierre was directly served. Additionally, Pierre’s improper and untimely invocation of Fifth Amendment privilege is not an adequate excuse. See Diamant v. GMS Diamonds Corp., No. 04 CV 2636, 2004 WL 2710028, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 2004) (holding that “any claim of privilege against self-incrimination is not an adequate excuse” for subpoena non-compliance). That stated, the Court’s power to hold a party in contempt is discretionary. 18 U.S.C. § 401. The Court’s contempt power “is an ‘inherent power’ of the court, ‘governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.’ ” Hernandez v. Sub Ents. Inc., 2023 WL 2390543, at *2 (quoting People by Abrams v. Terry, 45 F.3d 17, 23 (2d Cir. 1995)). Since the parties filed their briefs, the Court has recommended that the district court enter default judgment against Pierre (ECF No. 187), and his attorneys have moved to withdraw. (ECF No. 189). Considering Pierre has been in an unstable procedural posture pending default judgment and that his attorneys are attempting to withdraw, combined with the consideration that contempt is a drastic remedy, see Sterling Nat’l Bank v. A-1 Hotels, Int’l, Inc., 2004 WL 1418201, at *3, the Court will provide Pierre with a final opportunity to avoid being held in contempt of Court.2 However, if Pierre continues to defy the Court’s Orders to comply with the subpoena, it will recommend that the district court deploy sanctions upon him. CONCLUSION For the reasons stated above, the Court Orders defendant Pierre to produce the documents requested by the subpoena by October 8, 2025. The Court also denies plaintiff’s request to hold Pierre in contempt on the condition that Pierre comply with the Court’s Order to produce the documents requested. The parties shall file a status report as to compliance with this Order by October 10, 2025. Plaintiff’s Motion to strike Pierre’s January 31, 2025 reply is denied as moot. The Clerk is directed to send copies of this Order to the parties either electronically through the Electronic Case Filing (ECF) system or by mail. 2 Although plaintiff did not ask the Court to draw an adverse inference from Pierre’s Fifth Amendment privilege claim, the Court notes that an adverse inference is another remedy in civil matters where a party asserts the privilege because invoking the privilege disadvantages the opposing party by keeping them from obtaining information they could otherwise get. United States Securities & Exch. Comm’n v. Suman, 684 F. Supp. 2d 378, 386 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 11, 2010) (citing Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976)). The purpose of the adverse inference is to “restor[e] the prejudiced party to the same position he would have been absent” the failure to produce evidence. In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, No. 03 MDL 1570, 2017 WL 634706, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2017) (citing Kronisch v. United States, 150 F.3d 112, 126 (2d Cir. 1998)). Here, however, the Court recommended that the district court enter default judgment against Pierre as to liability (ECF No. 187). An Order allowing the trier of fact to draw an adverse inference would therefore do nothing to restore plaintiff to the same position it would have been in absent Pierre’s failure to comply with the subpoena.

Background Plaintiffs Sabrina Adkins and the Estate of Jennifer Hill1 bring this action against Defendants Ben Fields in his individual and official capacities, Billy Jones in his official capacity, and Eastern Kentucky Correctional Services Inc. (EKCS).2 See DE 57 (Second Am. Compl.). Fields is a former court security officer (CSO) for the Letcher County Sheriff’s Office (LCSO), and Jones3 is the Letcher County Sheriff. See DE 133 (Fields Depo.) at 40:1–7. EKCS provides ankle monitoring services for Letcher County. See DE 57 ¶ 5. EKCS hired Fields to oversee the ankle monitoring program for home incarceration in Letcher County while he was also a CSO. See id ¶¶ 86–87. This case involves Fields’s alleged sexual coercion of two women he supervised during their periods of home incarceration. 1 Though the Estate is the party-in-interest, the Court will refer to the Estate as “Hill” for ease of reference. 2 EKCS represents its name to be “Eastern Kentucky Corrections Services, Inc.” rather than “Eastern Kentucky Correctional Services, Inc.” See DE 155. However, until formal amendment, this Court will continue to refer to this Defendant by its name as forth in the pleadings. See DE 57. 3 The Second Amended Complaint originally brought claims against Mickey Stines in his official capacity as the Letcher County Sheriff. Because Stines is no longer Sheriff, the Court earlier substituted Jones as a defendant. See DE 147 (Order of Substitution). A. Fields’s Supervision of Adkins As alleged in the Second Amended Complaint, Adkins’s version of events is this: she was incarcerated in the Letcher County Jail from April 2021 through June 2021. See DE 57 at 3 ¶ 2. Upon her release, she was placed on home incarceration. See id. ¶ 3. Fields was assigned as Adkins’s home incarceration officer. See id. ¶ 4. When she expressed concern to Fields about her ability to pay for an ankle monitor, Adkins claims that Fields made “flirtatious comments” about her appearance and told her that they “could work something out.” See id. ¶ 9. Adkins understood Fields’s comments to imply that she would receive preferential treatment from Fields in exchange for sexual favors. See id ¶ 10. Adkins and Fields began communicating regularly via text message. See id. ¶ 11. In late June 2021, Fields asked Adkins to meet him “after dark” at the Letcher County Courthouse in District Judge Kevin Mullins’s chambers. See id. ¶¶ 12–13. In that first meeting, Fields removed Adkins’s ankle monitor, advising her that she would not have to pay the associated fees and could remain on home incarceration. See id. ¶ 14. Between late June 2021 and December 2021, Adkins alleges that she met Fields in Judge Mullins’s chambers several times, with their interactions escalating from “forcible kissing” to oral sex and intercourse. See id. ¶¶ 15–16. According to Adkins, she “was coerced and compelled to comply” due to Fields’s “position of power” and because she could not afford her ankle monitor. See id. ¶ 17. She feared that if she did not comply, she would have to return to the Letcher County Jail. See id. In December 2021, employees at the Letcher County Courthouse received notice of the relationship between Adkins and Fields. See id. ¶ 20. Fields filed a criminal complaint against Adkins in early January 2022 on the basis of non-compliance with the terms of home incarceration. See id. ¶ 23. She was then arrested. See id. ¶ 25. Adkins claims Fields filed the complaint to punish her and save his own job and reputation. See id. ¶ 24. Evidence produced in discovery regarding Fields’s supervision of Adkins is as follows: in her deposition, Adkins testified that she was arrested in April 2021 and booked in the Letcher County Jail. See DE 134 (Sabrina Adkins Depo.) 59:14–60:2. While incarcerated, she heard from fellow inmates that women would give Fields sexual favors so that they would not have to pay for their home incarceration fees. See id. at 73:4–14. She was released in June 2021 and placed on home incarceration. See id. at 59:23–60:2. Fields was assigned as her supervising officer. See id. at 60:8–11. The period of home incarceration extended from June 2021 through January 2022. See id. at 77:11–15. The night of her release, Fields bought Adkins cigarettes to “console” her after she experienced issues with securing housing. See id. at 63:13–64:24, 65:24–66:13. He also told her that she was “pretty” and had “pretty legs.” Id. at 84:2–7. During the interaction, she told Fields that she could not afford to pay for her ankle monitor. Id. at 67:22–67:10. She testified that at the time, she was “terrified” to return to the Letcher County Jail due to its “very poor” conditions. See id. at 69:9–14. Fields told her that “he could help [her] out, work out something.” Id. at 72:21– 73:1. Following this interaction, Adkins texted and messaged with Fields on a daily basis for about seven months. See id. at 76:17–78:24. This included messages and photographs that were admittedly “sexual in nature.” See id. at 115:4–116:1. She testified that the messages and photographs were “flirtatious.” See id. at 84:19–21, 85:8–20. However, Adkins stated that she flirted with Fields because it “was the only way that [she] thought that [she] would be okay on house arrest without paying.” Id. at 85:8–20. Sometime in 2021, at Fields’s request, Adkins met with him after hours at the Letcher County Courthouse in Judge Mullins’s private chambers. See id. at 81:7–16. During that meeting, she cried to him that she did not know how she would pay for her ankle monitor, and Fields removed her monitor. See id. at 81:14–21. This initiated a cycle where Fields would meet with Adkins in Judge Mullins’s chambers, take her monitor off, put it back on the day she had to appear in court, and then remove it again after court. See id. at 81:24–82:7. Fields and Adkins met in this manner between four and six times. See id. Upon their second or third meeting, physical contact between Adkins and Fields first occurred. See id. at 86:18–87:3. Adkins described the initial contact as involving “forcible kissing” since Fields “grabbed [her] and kissed [her] on the mouth.” See id. at 88:18–89:2. The first instance of sexual contact occurred between late November and early December of 2021, escalating to oral sex and sexual intercourse in subsequent meetings. See id. at 83:9–16, 89:11–90:3. To her memory, Fields made no physical threats against her. See id. at 146:12–15. In January 2022, Fields obtained a warrant against Adkins for failure to report to LCSO while on home incarceration. See id. at 144:6–9; DE 139-13 (Criminal Complaint). Adkins testified that she believed that engaging in sexual activity with Fields was her “only option at that time.” DE 134 at 91:1–10. She did “what [she] thought that [she] needed and had to do to stay out of jail.” Id. at 99:16–22. She felt “scared” and “terrified” because of the situation. See id. at 84:16–18, 145:23–146:3. In connection with his interactions with Adkins and another female inmate (B.C., a non- party to the current suit), Fields was criminally charged and ultimately pleaded guilty to third- degree rape, third-degree sodomy, tampering with a prison monitoring device, and second degree- perjury. See DE 139-12 (Fields Guilty Plea) at 1–2. The B.C. conviction involved only the tampering. Specifically, he admitted to “advis[ing] [Adkins] he would not require her to pay [the weekly home incarceration] fee, and would allow her to go without the ankle monitor in exchange for sexual favors.” Id. at 2. Consistent with Adkins’s deposition testimony, Fields further admitted that he would meet with her “the night before a court appearance to put the ankle monitor on” and then he “would remove it after court.” Id. After he was unable to provide a requesting judge with Adkins’s location coordinates, Fields admitted that he “obtained a sworn false criminal complaint” against her for escape “to cover up the fact he allowed her to not wear the ankle monitor.” Id. B. Fields’s Supervision of Hill Hill alleges a similar scenario in the Second Amended Complaint: she was incarcerated at the Letcher County Jail in 2019, placed on home incarceration in August 2020, and supervised by Fields. See DE 57 ¶¶ 29–31. Fields also told Hill that if she could not pay the ankle monitor fees, they “could work something out,” meaning that if she “would do him a favor, he would do her a favor.” See id. ¶¶ 33–34. Like Adkins, Hill understood Fields’s comments to imply that he would waive her fees in exchange for sexual favors. See id. ¶ 35. After Hill rebuffed Fields, he arrested her a few days later, claiming that her home did not comply with the home incarceration requirements. See id. ¶ 36. After her release for that arrest, Hill was arrested again several months later, and again, she was placed on home incarceration under Fields’s supervision. See id. ¶¶ 40– 42. Upon her release, Fields visited Hill at her house, warning her that he would arrest her if she did not follow his instructions. See id. ¶¶ 47–50. Hill states that Fields commanded her to get into the front seat of his vehicle and perform oral sex on him. See id. ¶¶ 51–52. She “involuntarily complied.” Id. ¶ 53. Multiple further instances of sexual contact between Fields and Hill occurred in a similar manner. See id. ¶¶ 58–61. He consistently reminded her that she “needed to keep him happy” or else she could be arrested again. See id. ¶ 65. According to Hill, she “was coerced and compelled to comply” with Fields’s instructions, given his “position of power over her.” See id. ¶ 66. In approximately October 2021, Fields demanded sex from Hill at her home, but she refused. See id. ¶ 68. During the same visit, Fields agreed that Hill could visit her newborn granddaughter in London, Kentucky, and removed her ankle monitor. See id. ¶ 69. Thereafter, Fields reported Hill for a violation of her bond conditions, and she was again arrested. See id. ¶ 70. Documentation in the record shows that Hill completed one period of home incarceration from September 2, 2021, through October 13, 2021. See DE 139-15 (Hill Incarceration Completion Form). Hill’s fiancé (Chris Triplett) states in an affidavit that that “sometime during [her] period of home incarceration,” he “became aware” that Fields commanded Hill to perform oral sex and “submit to sexual intercourse.” DE 139-9 (Triplett Aff.) ¶ 4. However, he sets the timeframe when he first became aware that Fields “was forcing” Hill “to provide sexual favors” as December 2019. See id. ¶ 3. There is no affidavit or sworn testimony in the record from Hill, who passed away in 2023. C. Oversight of Fields 1. Training and Supervision on Sexual Misconduct LCSO maintains a policy manual with a sexual misconduct policy. See DE 139-3 (Sexual Misconduct Policy). Fields signed an acknowledgement that he received the policy manual. See DE 136-6 (Signed Acknowledgment). LCSO also had in force a policy regulating deputy ethics and requiring adherence to proper standards. DE 136-5. While Former Letcher County Sheriff Mickey Stines testified that he “[didn’t] recall” whether LCSO conducted any annual trainings on its policies, see DE 135 (Stines Depo.) at 82:24–83:17, Fields confirmed that he reviewed LCSO’s policies, see DE 133 at 49:11–21. He recognized his obligation to abide by LCSO policies. See id. at 96. Stines also separately verified that Fields was “trained” and completed “biannual updated training” to maintain his CSO certification, and “was required to be familiar with and follow department policies and procedures” that “address excessive force, abuse of power, sexual contact, sexual abuse and sexual harassment.” See DE 143-16 (Interrogatory Responses) at 2. Per Stines, he had an obligation to enforce policies, and he ensured that deputies received the policies. See DE 135 at 35. Though LCSO had its own formal and detailed policies for handling complaints against deputies, see DE 140-1, Stines testified that he would generally speak to any individual that raised complaints about a deputy. See DE 135 at 101:8–18; 106:15–22. Stines advised complainants to put any formal complaint in writing. See id. In his tenure, he only received verbal complaints. See id. Upon receipt of a verbal complaint, he would speak to the respective deputy. See id. Evidence shows that, over the course of time, Stines, Fields, and other LCSO employees regularly sent each other graphics of sexual imagery and made sex-related and crude comments via Facebook. See DE 139-6 (Message Thread); DE 139-7 (Message Thread). Stines later testified and conceded that this set a “horrible” example as far as “[a]cting unprofessional.” See DE 135 at 136:13–137:1. As for any pre-existing complaints about Fields, B.C. stated in an interview that “[her] mom, she told [Stines], she said, ‘I have to live in this town but you – but I know why he won’t give it to her’” regarding why Fields would not allow B.C. home incarceration. See DE 143-19 (Interview Transcript). Stines denies that B.C.’s mother made a report to him about Fields. See DE 135 at 138:1–16. Around December 15, 2021, Triplett claims that he also reported Fields for his sexual abuse of Hill via telephone to LCSO and in person to an “unknown employee” of LCSO. DE 139-9 ¶¶ 5–6. The employee allegedly “refused” the report and “laughed at” him. Id. 2. Training and Supervision on Secondary Employment Policy LCSO also has a “secondary employment policy,” which provides that in cases where an LCSO employee seeks to perform “law enforcement duties” for another employer, the secondary employer must secure a permit of approval from LCSO. See DE 139-4 (Secondary Employment Policy) at 1. The employee must also obtain separate written approval for any “outside employment” (“[e]mployment of a non-police nature in which vested police powers are not a condition of employment”) on an annual basis through the chain of command. See id. at 3. Stines testified that he did not “recall” any instances of a secondary employer receiving a permit from LCSO, or an employee seeking approval for outside employment, although in rare instances he gave verbal approval. DE 135 at 84:3–92:4. Stines certainly knew that Fields worked for EKCS— indeed, Stines held the job previously, and he recommended Fields and trained him for that work. See id. at 62-63. D. Procedural History Plaintiffs bring the following claims: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims against Fields under the Fourth Amendment for unreasonable search and seizure (Count I) and the Fourteenth Amendment for violation of substantive due process rights, specifically the right to be free from sexual abuse (Count II); § 1983 claims against EKCS and Jones for failure to supervise and train (Count III); state law claims against Fields for negligence, gross negligence, assault and battery, grossly negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotion distress (Counts IV, V, and VI); and a state law claim against EKCS for negligent retention, training, and supervision (Count VII). See DE 57 ¶¶ 123–169. Plaintiffs seek an award of compensatory and punitive damages. See id. at 23. Defendants Fields and Jones move for summary judgment. See DE 136 (Motion for Official Capacity Claims); DE 152 (Motion for Individual Capacity Claims). Plaintiffs have responded, and Defendants have filed their respective replies. See DE 139 (Response); DE 159 (Response); DE 143 (Reply); DE 161 (Reply). Defendant EKCS, though making no independent arguments, also moves to join its co-defendants’ motions for summary judgment. See DE 155 (Motion to Join). Plaintiffs separately file a motion to reopen discovery and hold consideration of the pending summary judgment motions in abeyance. See DE 153 (Motion); DE 157 (Response); DE 158 (Response); DE 162 (Notice of Filing). All motions are fully briefed and ready for review. II. Standard Pursuant to Rule 56(a), summary judgment is appropriate if “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of showing the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2553 (1986). If the moving party satisfies its burden, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to produce “specific facts” showing a “genuine issue” for trial. Id. (quotation marks omitted) (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 56(e)). “A genuine dispute of material fact exists if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Wright v. City of Euclid, 962 F.3d 852, 864 (6th Cir. 2020) (citation and quotation marks omitted). In determining whether a genuine dispute exists, the Court considers all facts and draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indust. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356 (1986); Lindsay v. Yates, 578 F.3d 407, 414 (6th Cir. 2009). Rule 56 does not require that the evidence considered, at the summary judgment stage, then be admissible. Obviously, Rule 56(c)(1)(A) references a host of materials, “in the record,” that may form the decisional basis. For this reason, many such items might present proof that would not, in the instant form, make it into the trial record. Thus, an affidavit must be “made on personal knowledge [and] set out facts that would be admissible in evidence[.]” See id. at (c)(4). “[T]he party opposing summary judgment must show that she can make good on the promise of the pleadings by laying out enough evidence that will be admissible at trial to demonstrate that a genuine issue on a material fact exists, and that a trial is necessary.” Alexander v. CareSource, 576 F.3d 551, 558 (6th Cir. 2009). Such “‘evidence submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment must be admissible.’” Alpert v. United States, 481 F.3d 404, 409 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting United States Structures, Inc. v. J.P. Structures, Inc., 130 F.3d 1185, 1189 (6th Cir. 1997)). That is why “‘[h]earsay evidence . . . must be disregarded.’” Id. Further, courts, “in determining whether to consider hearsay evidence, may inquire as to whether the party opposing summary judgment is capable of producing an otherwise inadmissible hearsay statement in a form that will be admissible at trial, i.e., via substituted oral testimony by the third-party declarant.” Wyatt v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., 999 F.3d 400, 424 (6th Cir. 2021). III. Analysis A. Motion to Reopen Discovery Plaintiffs move to reopen discovery for a period of 180 days and hold the Court’s resolution of the summary judgment motions in abeyance. See DE 153. Their request arises out of public statements allegedly made by a lawyer representing Stines in his pending criminal case regarding the death of Judge Mullins. See id. Stines is accused of shooting and killing Judge Mullins in his chambers on September 19, 2024, three days after he was deposed in this matter. See id. at 1–2. The lawyer’s statements, as reported in an online news article, are as follows:4 I think one of the big things is that my client felt there had been pressure placed on him not to say too much during the deposition, and not to talk about things that happened within the courthouse, particularly in the judge’s chambers. . . . On the day that this [shooting] happened, my client had attempted multiple times to contact his wife and daughter, and he firmly believed that they were in danger. . . . He believed that they were in danger because of what he knew to have happened within the courthouse. And there was pressure, and there were threats made to him 4 While the Court attempted to access the online article, the article is apparently no longer available. to sort of keep him in line, to keep them from saying more than these folks wanted him to say. Id. at 2. The lawyer also indicated that “Stines was under pressure by his peers not to say too much during the proceedings in the civil lawsuit.” Id. Plaintiffs argue that it is necessary to re-depose Stines “because he was not truthful in his prior deposition in this action.” Id. at 2. The Court is unwilling to shift course, reopen discovery, and stay the summary judgment motions based on what amounts to unsworn hearsay statements reproduced as online fodder. Moreover, contrary to Plaintiffs’ characterization, the lawyer never actually stated that Stines was untruthful in his deposition. While Stines’s deposition is certainly relevant to the claims at issue, Plaintiffs did not sue Stines individually, and his only status was as an official defendant. Because he is no longer the Letcher County Sheriff, Stines is not even an extant party to this lawsuit. See DE 147. Discovery closed long ago, see DE 121, and summary judgment motions are fully briefed. The case was originally filed over three years ago, and the underlying events took place four years ago. At this point, delaying resolution by an additional six months is untenable; frankly, even that prediction seems doubtful given the circumstances Stines faces. A well-developed and plenary record, including Stines’s sworn testimony, subject to cross-examination, exists. The Court denies Plaintiffs’ request. B. Hill’s Claims When a federal statute does not specify a statute of limitations period, courts borrow “the most analogous state limitations period.” McCormick v. Miami Univ., 693 F.3d 654, 662 (6th Cir. 2012). 42 U.S.C. § 1983 does not contain a limitations period; thus, the Sixth Circuit looks to the relevant state’s statute of limitations for personal injury claims. Wright v. Louisville Metro Gov’t, 144 F.4th 817, 824 (6th Cir. 2025). In Kentucky, the statute of limitations for such claims is one year. See id. (citing KRS § 413.140(1)(a)). The same one-year statute of limitations applies to negligence, assault, and battery claims. See KRS § 413.140(1)(a) (stating that a plaintiff must file “[a]n action for an injury to the person of the plaintiff” within one year after the claim accrues). In cases where the court borrows the limitations period from state law, the claims still “accrue and the statutory period begins to run according to federal law.” Bishop v. Children’s Ctr. for Developmental Enrichment, 618 F.3d 533, 536 (6th Cir. 2010); see also Hall v. Knott Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 941 F.2d 402, 408 (6th Cir. 1991) (“The date on which the plaintiff\\'s claims accrued is a matter governed by federal law.”). Under federal law, “[t]he statute of limitations begins to run when a plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his action.” Am. Premier Underwriters, Inc. v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 839 F.3d 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2016) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Under Kentucky law, the statute of limitations begins to run when the challenged conduct “causes injury that produces loss or damage.” Abel v. Austin, 411 S.W.3d 728, 736 (Ky. 2013) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The impetus for Hill’s allegations and thus, her claims, is the allegedly coerced sexual contact between her and Fields. See generally DE 57. Therefore, Hill knew of the contact (the injury-producing conduct) when it first occurred, triggering the statute of limitations. While the operative complaint sets the timeline for Fields’s conduct vis-à-vis Hill as occurring between August 2020 through October 2021, see DE 57 ¶¶ 31, 68, her fiancé (Chris Triplett) states that he became aware that Fields “was forcing” Hill “to provide sexual favors” to him in December 2019. See DE 139-9 ¶ 3. Based on this affidavit, Hill had (at latest)5 until December 2020 (one year later) to file her § 1983, negligence, assault, and battery claims. Because, as Fields argues, Hill did not initiate the instant action until January 31, 2022, those claims are time-barred. 5 December 2019 is only when Triplett himself learned of the contact, meaning that the contact logically occurred earlier. The record contains no other date from which the Court can calibrate the limitations analysis. In response, Hill points to documentation showing that she completed a home incarceration period that ran from September 2, 2021, through October 13, 2021. See DE 139-15. The issue is that the completion form says nothing about when the contact between Hill and Fields occurred. Indeed, the form includes no information about who was supervising Hill6 during this period. By Hill’s own allegations, she served multiple periods of home incarceration. See, e.g., DE 57 ¶¶ 31, 41. Hill also relies on Triplett’s affidavit, which states that “sometime during [her] period of home incarceration,” Triplett “became aware” that Fields commanded Hill to perform oral sex and “submit to sexual intercourse.”7 DE 139-9 ¶ 4. Again, this affidavit does not state when during Hill’s home incarceration the sexual contact transpired. The only date tied to the alleged sexual misconduct is the December 2019 date listed within the same affidavit. See DE 139-9 ¶ 3. Absent affirmative evidence that sexual contact occurred at a later date, Hill fails to genuinely dispute that December 2019 serves as the reference point for claim accrual. Since she did not file suit until after the one-year limitations period expired, her § 1983, negligence, gross negligence, assault, and battery claims are time-barred. The Court accordingly grants summary judgment on these claims and dismisses them. Importantly, there simply is not cognizable proof supporting Hill’s claims about misconduct by Fields in 2021, which would spare claims as to timeliness. Hill is now deceased, and nothing captures her personal knowledge in a way that, under any colorable theory, would be 6 A mostly illegible signature on the form could, construing evidence in Hill’s favor, read as “B Fields.” Still, he is not identified as her supervising officer during this period, and even if he was, she fails to submit any evidence that the sexual misconduct arose throughout the course of this particular instance of home incarceration. 7 Although not raised by Hill, the Court rejects any “continuing violations” theory such that the Court could “consider as timely all relevant violations including those that would otherwise be time-barred.” Bruce v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., 389 F. App’x 462, 466 (6th Cir. 2010) (citation and quotation marks omitted). To the extent that theory is even cognizable based on the claims presented, Hill has not established, with specific evidence, that any sexual contact between her and Fields happened after December 2019. admissible. There was no deposition, and there is no affidavit. Although Hill signed the complaint at DE 17, purporting to verify, that document is not notarized, and she does not sign under penalty of perjury as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1746. The recorded statement in the record is not verified and is not a deposition. This means there is no proof on the timeliness, and quite notably, there would be no admissible proof on the facts alleged by Hill against Fields. Fields denies any impropriety toward Hill. See DE 133 at 104. Given Hill’s untimely passing, and the absence of any perpetuated testimony, Hill would not, in any event, be in a position to prove this case at trial. As to timeliness, and alternatively, what of Hill’s intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) claims? As a general matter, IIED and NIED claims are subject to a five-year limitations period. See Craft v. Rice, 671 S.W.2d 247, 251 (Ky. 1984) (citing the predecessor to KRS § 413.120(6)). However, “a complaint cannot be saved from limitations by pleading [emotional distress claims] to reach the longer statute when the facts support a claim for a more traditional personal injury tort with mental pain and suffering as part of the damages rather than severe emotional distress caused by outrageous conduct.” Childers v. Geile, 367 S.W.3d 576, 582–83 (Ky. 2012). Here is where the statute of limitations for IIED and NIED claims begins to merge with the viability of these so-called “gap-filler” torts; IIED and NIED claims are “available only where a more traditional tort cannot provide redress for” emotional distress. Green v. Floyd Cnty., 803 F. Supp. 2d 652, 655 (E.D. Ky. 2011); see also Downing v. Petry, Civil Action No. 5:20-187-DCR, 2021 WL 707654, at *4 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 23, 2021). Since “[t]here can be only one recovery for emotional distress on the same acts,” Childers, 367 S.W.3d at 582–83, an emotional distress claim is not viable if an “actor’s conduct amounts to the commission of one of the traditional torts such as assault, battery, or negligence for which recovery for emotional distress is allowed.” Rigazio v. Archdiocese of Louisville, 853 S.W.2d 295, 298–99 (Ky. Ct. App. 1993). This rule is subject to one exception: IIED and NIED are “still [] permissible cause[s] of action, despite the availability of more traditional torts, as long as the defendant[] solely intended to cause extreme emotional distress.” Green, 803 F. Supp. 2d at 655 (emphasis added). Fields maintains that a one-year limitations period also governs the IIED and NIED claims due to the factual overlap between these claims and Hill’s other tort claims. See DE 152-1 (Memorandum in Support) at 23–24. The Court agrees that the factual allegations underlying Hill’s traditional tort claims (negligence, gross negligence, assault, and battery) duplicate those underlying her IIED and NIED claims. In pleading their NIED claim, Plaintiffs directly rely on the facts of their other tort claims, alleging that “[a]s a direct and proximate result of the above- described grossly negligent conduct of Defendant Fields, Plaintiffs suffered and continue to suffer severe emotional distress.” DE 57 ¶ 156 (emphasis added). Similarly, in pleading their IIED claim, Plaintiffs also state that “[t]he above-described actions of Defendant Fields were intentional and are outrageous and offend generally accepted community standards of decency and morality.” Id. ¶ 159 (emphasis added). Her traditional tort claims (the negligence and assault and battery claims) also allow for the recovery of emotional distress damages. See Rigazio, 853 S.W.2d at 298–99. Given the factual overlap and the availability of emotional distress damages, the IIED and NIED claims are substantively preempted. Cf. Gibson v. Slone, Civil No. 10-145-ART, 2011 WL 2009815, at *3 (E.D. Ky. May 23, 2011) (rejecting IIED claim because the plaintiff “could have recovered damages for emotional distress on his assault-and-battery claim,” even though that claim was time-barred). Those claims would not, then, avoid the time bar. And again, Hill does not show the ability to offer first-hand proof on the merits of her claims. The Court acknowledges one potential wrinkle: neither party addresses whether Fields’s sole intent in engaging in the alleged sexual contact was to cause Hill extreme emotional distress versus for some other reason (i.e., sexual gratification). If Fields solely intended to cause Hill extreme emotional distress, then the NIED and IIED claims could exist as separate, standalone claims with a five-year limitations period. See Green, 803 F. Supp. 2d at 655. Intent typically is an inherently fact-based determination best left for the jury. Perhaps, then, the Court should reserve for trial the limitations question on the emotional distress claims. Even if the five-year limitations period applied and rendered the IIED and NIED claims timely, those claims fail for other reasons. To establish an IIED claim, a plaintiff must prove: (1) “intentional or reckless conduct;” (2) “conduct that is outrageous and intolerable because it offends against generally accepted standards of decency and morality;” (3) “a causal connection between the conduct and emotional distress;” and (4) “emotional distress which is severe.” Childers, 367 S.W.3d at 579. An NIED claim requires the plaintiff to prove: (1) “the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff;” (2) “breach of that duty;” (3) “severe” or “serious” emotional injury such that “a reasonable person, normally constituted, would not be expected to endure the mental stress engendered by the circumstances of the case;” and (4) “legal causation between the defendant’s breach and the plaintiff’s injury.” Osborne v. Keeney, 399 S.W.3d 1, 17 (Ky. 2012). For both NIED and IIED claims, the plaintiff “must present expert medical or scientific proof to support the claimed [emotional] injury or impairment.” Id. at 17–18; cf. Ind. Ins. Co. v. Demetre, 527 S.W.3d 12, 39 (Ky. 2017) (“Osborne’s requirement of expert medical or scientific proof is limited to claims of intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress.”). According to Fields, Hill’s emotional distress claims fail because she has not shown “severe emotional distress” (IIED), a “severe” or “serious” emotional injury (NIED), or expert proof of the claimed emotional distress. See DE 152-1 at 27–30. Hill does not produce any evidence in support of her emotional distress claims to counter Fields’s position and place those claims in dispute; the response briefing fails to address or try to preserve these claims. Because, alternatively, Hill has not submitted any evidence, buttressed by expert proof, of the requisite emotional injuries, her NIED and IIED claims do not survive summary judgment. The Court grants summary judgment on those claims. Accordingly, Hill’s claims are dismissed against all defendants in their entirety. C. Adkins’s Claims 1. Claims against Fields – Individual a. Federal Claims Adkins brings two federal claims pursuant to § 1983 against Fields, alleging violations of her constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. Both relate to Fields’s alleged sexual abuse of Adkins and the physical contact between them. See DE 57 ¶¶ 123–138. The analysis of Adkins’s claims and the relevant constitutional provisions depends on her status while on home incarceration. See Hale v. Boyle Cnty., 18 F.4th 845, 852 (6th Cir. 2021) (“Persons in the criminal justice system invoke different constitutional amendments in their 42 U.S.C. § 1983 suits depending on their status.”). While not discussed at length by any party, the record indicates that because Adkins was on home incarceration while awaiting resolution of pending charges, she was initially a pretrial detainee. See DE 143-2 (Adkins Conditions of Release). Because she was in the context of a pretrial detainee, the Fourteenth Amendment governs her § 1983 claims. See Hale, 18 F.4th at 852. Hale v. Boyle County provides the binding standard for claims involving sexual conduct between a law enforcement official and a pretrial detainee, construing such claims as Fourteenth Amendment excessive-force claims. See id. at 852–54. In Hale, the Sixth Circuit created a “rebuttable-presumption” framework. Id. at 854. A pretrial detainee is “entitled to a presumption that the conduct was not consensual.” Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted). The defendant- officer may “rebut this presumption” if he “affirmatively show[s]” that “the conduct involved no coercive factors.” Id. Coercive factors include (but are not limited to) “explicit assertions or manifestations of non-consent,” and “favors, privileges, or any type of exchange for sex.” Id. Defendants’ lead position is one of consent. This difficult proposition—where an officer, with the power to control the liberty of a vulnerable female, committed a sex crime in the course of supervision of that female—is one for the jury. The Court finds that there is a genuine (if dubious) dispute of material fact as to whether Adkins consented to the sexual contact with Fields. Thus, her claim against Fields can proceed. Based on the record, a reasonable jury could find that Adkins did not consent to the sexual contact with Fields based on the coercive factors present. First, the clearest example, the evidence of an exchange between Adkins and Fields: as admitted in his guilty plea, Fields did not require Adkins to wear her ankle monitor or pay her home incarceration fees in exchange for sexual favors. See DE 139-12 at 2. Upon her release to home incarceration, Adkins told Fields that she could not afford to pay for her ankle monitor. See DE 134 at 67:22–68:9. He responded that “he could help [her] out, work out something.” Id. at 72:21–73:1. In that same conversation, Fields also commented that Adkins was “pretty” and had “pretty legs,” which a reasonable jury could find set the tone for a physical relationship. Id. at 84:2–7. On multiple occasions, Adkins met with Fields in Judge Mullins’s chambers, where Fields would attach her ankle monitor in advance of a court appearance and remove it after the appearance. See id. at 81:24–82: 7. These meetings and the consequential locale are also where the kissing, oral sex, and sexual intercourse occurred. Id. 88:23–90:3. The stakes were very high for Adkins: if she did not pay the requisite fee or wear her ankle monitor properly, she likely would have to return to the Letcher County Jail. See id. at 69:9– 14. She was “terrified” to return to the Letcher County Jail due to its “very poor” conditions. Id. Ultimately, Fields held the strings on whether Adkins would return to jail. Indeed, he eventually wielded his power against her, filing a “false” criminal complaint against Adkins to cover up their arrangement. See id. at 144:6–9; DE 139-12. That act put Adkins back in jail. Thus, Fields’s promise to help Adkins and his later circumvention of her home incarceration requirements, in light of these stakes and in conjunction with sexual activity, are strongly indicative of coercion. Adkins was a victim of Fields’s adjudicated crimes, so the argument in favor of consent is thin gruel. A reasonable jury could also conclude that evidence of Adkins’s subjective experience indicates a lack of consent. See Hale, 18 F.4th at 854 (explaining that “subjective intimidation” was “evidence that the encounters were not consensual”). Adkins testified that she engaged in sexual conduct with Fields because it “was the only way that [she] thought that [she] would be okay on house arrest without paying.” See DE 134 at 85:8–20. She also testified that the sexual contact was her “only option at that time,” and that she did “what [she] thought that [she] needed and had to do to stay out of jail.” See id. at 91:1–10, 99:16–22. And she felt “scared” and “terrified” because of the situation. See id. at 84:16–18, 145:23–146:3. Still other evidence also implies coercion. Where and when their interactions occurred suggest a coercive atmosphere—Adkins and Fields met after hours in a judge’s private chambers in the courthouse. See DE 134 at 81:7–16. The county jail was in the basement. In the first instance of physical contact, Adkins testified that Fields “forcibl[y] kiss[ed]” her and “grabbed [her] and kissed [her] on the mouth.” See id. at 88:18–89:2. Such physical contact is an unmistakable marker of non-consent. Fields also bestowed gifts on Adkins, such as the cigarettes he bought to “console” her. See id. at 63:13–64:24, 65:24–66:13. Fields was criminally charged and pleaded guilty to third-degree rape and third-degree sodomy for his relationship with Fields, signifying non-consent and the role of his official power in the crimes. See DE 139-12 at 2. Taken together, a reasonable jury could easily conclude that the present coercive factors rendered the sexual contact between Adkins and Fields non-consensual. To overcome the presumption of non-consent, Fields points to evidence that Adkins admitted to making “flirtatious comments” to Fields and exchanging Facebook messages and photographs with Fields that were “sexual in nature.” See DE 134 at 84:19–21, 115:4–116; see generally DE 143-20 (Excerpts of Messages). And she texted with Fields on a daily basis for a period of about seven months. See id. at 76:17–78:24. Other evidence suggests Adkins initiated the arrangement: she stated that she heard from fellow inmates that women would give Fields sexual favors to get out of paying their home incarceration fees. See id. at 73:4-14. She also sent a message to Fields, stating, “Listen I [] have to work something out so I can enjoy my Life.” DE 143-20 at 8. Finally, Adkins does not recall Fields making any physical threats against her. See DE 134 at 146:12–15. True enough, Adkins made certain expressions of mutuality to the person in control of her liberty. The jury can grapple with the power dynamics, Adkins’s extremity, and Fields’s behavior in resolving the question of consent—that is for the factfinder, not the Court. Due to the conflicting evidence on the issue of consent, the Court denies summary judgment as to Adkins’s Fourteenth Amendment claim against Fields.8 8 Adkins was on bond, and the defense complains that she did not have pretrial detention status. She was on “house arrest,” and thus in a margin between release and detention. The due process concept of bodily integrity also would apply, in this context, to the extent there are questions about home incarceration as an equivalent to pretrial detention. To quote the Circuit: This court has previously held that “no rational individual could believe that sexual abuse by a state actor is constitutionally permissible under the Due Process Clause” and that a citizen has “a clearly established right under the substantive component of the Due Process Clause to personal security and to bodily integrity[.]”” However, the Court grants summary judgment as to Adkins’s Fourth Amendment claim. “[I]f a constitutional claim is covered by a specific constitutional provision . . . the claim must be analyzed under the standard appropriate to that specific provision[.]” United States v. Lanier, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 1228 n.7 (1997). Since the Fourteenth Amendment covers Adkins’s claim, the Fourth Amendment is superfluous and inapplicable. Regardless, “[t]he Fourth Amendment is meant to apply when evaluating the reasonableness of searches and seizures,” and no evidence indicates that the sexual contact occurred during a search or seizure. Carnes v. Hall, 665 F. Supp. 3d 831, 843 (E.D. Ky. 2023). Thus, the Court dismisses the Fourth Amendment claim, which does not apply in concept and unnecessarily complicates the field. Fields also raises a qualified immunity defense. See DE 152-1 at 22–23. Qualified immunity protects a public official from liability unless (1)“the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,” and (2) “the right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the challenged conduct.” Hodges v. City of Grand Rapids, 139 F.4th 495, 504 (6th Cir. 2025). Because there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Fields violated Adkins’s Fourteenth Amendment rights, the Court cannot find, at this stage, that Fields is entitled to qualified immunity. Fields does not argue with any seriousness that coerced sex by a law enforcement officer, with a person under the officer’s control, would not clearly fall out of bounds. The Court therefore denies summary judgment on this ground. Doe v. Magoffin Cnty. Fiscal Ct., 174 F. App’x 962, 966–67 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting Doe v. Claiborne Cnty., Tenn., 103 F.3d 495, 507 (6th Cir. 1996)); see also Sexton v. Cernuto, 18 F.4th 177, 191 (6th Cir. 2021)(recognizing clearly established due process interest against sexual assault by state actor and applying concept to a probationer sexually assaulted during a probation work program). The Court sees no reason that the Fourteenth Amendment avenue would change the consent analysis. b. State Claims As with his constitutional claims, Fields contends that Adkins’s negligence, gross negligence, assault, and battery fail because his sexual contact with Adkins was consensual. See DE 152-1 at 24–27. Since consent obviously is disputed, the Court denies summary judgment as to these claims for the same reasons as the Fourteenth Amendment claim. To the extent Fields relies on the issue of consent to argue that punitive damages are not recoverable, the Court also denies summary judgment. On this record, a jury could reasonably find that the evidence of non-consensual sexual contact establishes Fields’s wanton and reckless disregard for Adkins’s rights, thereby potentially justifying punitive damages. Gibson v. Fuel Transp., Inc., 410 S.W.3d 56, 59 (Ky. 2013) (“In order to justify punitive damages there must be first a finding of failure to exercise reasonable care, and then an additional finding that this negligence was accompanied by wanton or reckless disregard for the lives, safety, or property of others.”) (citation and quotation marks omitted); KRS 411.184(1)(c)(defining “malice” for purposes of punitive damages statute). Again, Fields committed a sex crime against Adkins, and a criminal act surely supports a cognizable theory on punitive damages. Adkins’s IIED and NIED claims fail for the same reasons as Hill’s emotional distress claims. The factual allegations underlying Adkins’s traditional tort claims overlap with those underlying her IIED and NIED theories, and the traditional tort claims allow for emotional distress damages. See DE 57 ¶¶ 156, 159. Adkins points to no evidence showing that Fields’s sole intent in engaging in the alleged sexual contact was to cause her extreme emotional distress. Adkins also fails to produce any expert evidence in support of either claim. Due to this dearth of evidence, the Court grants summary judgment for the defense on Adkins’s emotional distress claims. This leaves only the negligence, gross negligence, and assault and battery claims. As the defense notes, though, the theory against Fields is one of intentional wrongdoing, not negligence. In the context of this case, and given the primacy of intentional action in the narrative, the Court will dismiss the negligence-based theories against Fields. The Court here relies on the principles of Ten Broeck Dupont, Inc. v. Brooks, 283 S.W.3d 705, 732–33 (Ky. 2009). Ten Broeck recognizes that negligence and assault and battery claims are “mutually exclusive” and that there is no such thing as negligent assault. See id. To avoid the doctrinally unsound notion of submitting negligence claims regarding Fields’s intentional acts (acts already largely adjudicated, as to him), the Court will dismiss those theories as to Fields. Finally, Fields also briefly raises a qualified official immunity defense for his state law claims. See DE 152-1 at 30–31. Under Kentucky law, a defendant is entitled to official immunity on a tort claim if his conduct was (1) a discretionary act or function; (2) taken “in good faith”; and (3) within the official scope of the defendant’s authority. See Yanero v. Davis, 65 S.W.3d 510, 522 (Ky. 2001). Kentucky’s immunity inquiry follows a burden-shifting scheme. See id. at 523. The defendant must first make a prima facie showing that “the act was performed within the scope of [his] discretionary authority.” Id. Then, “the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish by direct or circumstantial evidence that the discretionary act was not performed in good faith,” i.e., bad faith. Id.; see also Rowan Cnty. v. Sloas, 201 S.W.3d 469, 475 (Ky. 2006) (“‘Good faith,’ however, is somewhat of a misnomer, as the proof is really of ‘bad faith.’ In fact, in most cases, ‘good faith’ is just a presumption that exists absent evidence of ‘bad faith.’”). Here, in raising this defense, Fields only focuses on the “good faith” element, without attempting to meet his burden to provide evidence that his conduct was within the scope of his discretionary authority as a CSO. See DE 152-1 at 30–31. For his failure to meet his initial burden alone, his defense fails also. Similar to his other arguments, Fields states that because the sexual contact with Adkins was consensual, he acted in good faith. See DE 152-1 at 31. On her part, Adkins points to Fields’s dishonesty and alleged sexual abuse of women within the purview of his supervision. See DE 159 at 9. The Court finds that the evidence of Adkins’s lack of consent already discussed, Fields’s filing of a false criminal complaint, and his guilty plea to perjury (and felony sex crimes) plainly is enough to vanquish good faith at the gate. Therefore, the Court denies summary judgment as to Fields’s qualified official immunity defense on the state claims. 2. Official Capacity Claims against Fields and Jones Adkins seeks relief against Jones only in his official capacity as the Letcher County Sheriff. Through the official capacity claim, “the plaintiff seeks damages not from the individual officer, but from the entity for which the officer is an agent.” Cady v. Arenac Cnty., 574 F.3d 334, 342 (6th Cir. 2009) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Therefore, “[a]n official capacity suit is, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity.” Id. This principle applies to both federal and Kentucky law. See id.; Simpson v. Thompson, No. 2011-CA-001726-MR, 2012 WL 2946217, at *5 (Ky. Ct. App. July 20, 2012). Thus, the Court construes the § 1983 failure to train and supervise claim against Jones in his official capacity as one against LCSO. The official capacity claims against Fields likewise are construed as against LCSO. a. Federal Claims Section 1983 does not hold municipal entities vicariously liable for the illegal actions of their employees. See McQueen v. Beecher Cmty. Sch., 433 F.3d 460, 471 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 98 S. Ct. 2018 (1978)). To plead a municipal entity liability claim under § 1983, a plaintiff “must demonstrate that the alleged federal violation occurred because of a municipal policy or custom.” Franklin v. Franklin Cnty., 115 F.4th 461, 470 (6th Cir. 2024) (citation and quotation marks omitted). This requires the plaintiff to (1) identify an existing illegal policy or custom; (2) connect the policy or custom to the municipal entity; and (3) show that the claimed injury was caused by the execution of the policy or custom. See id. at 471. The Sixth Circuit has recognized four ways that a plaintiff may prove “the existence of a municipality’s illegal policy or custom”: (1) the municipality’s legislative enactments or official agency policies; (2) actions taken by officials with final decision-making authority; (3) a policy of inadequate training or supervision; or (4) a custom of tolerance or acquiescence of federal rights violations. Id. at 470 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff Adkins pursues the third avenue, claiming that LCSO maintained a policy of inadequate training and supervision.9 To establish a failure-to-train or -supervise claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) “the training or supervision was inadequate for the tasks performed;” (2) “the inadequacy was the result of the [municipal entity’s] deliberate indifference;” and (3) the inadequate training or supervision “actually caused the plaintiff’s injury.” Mosier v. Evans, 90 F.4th 541, 549 (6th Cir. 2024). A municipality acts with “deliberate indifference” if the “violation of a clearly established right was a known or obvious consequence” of the inadequate training or supervision. Gambrel v. Knox Cnty., 25 F.4th 391, 408 (6th Cir. 2022) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Typically, this requires proof that the municipality failed to act “in the face of repeated, known, rights violations,” including a “pattern of similar constitutional violations separate from the conduct that harmed the plaintiff.” See id.; Mosier, 90 F.4th at 549. In “a narrow range of circumstances,” see 9 In response to LCSO’s motion for summary judgment, Adkins also relies on the acquiescence theory of Monell liability. This theory was never raised in her Second Amended Complaint, so the defendants did not have proper notice of the theory. Therefore, the Court only considers the failure-to-train and failure-to- supervise theory. See West v. Wayne Cnty., 672 F. App’x 535, 541 (6th Cir. 2016) (disallowing First Amendment claim based on a political association theory when the complaint only alleged a free speech theory). Mosier, 90 F.4th at 549, “evidence of a single violation of federal rights” is sufficient if “accompanied by a showing that the [entity] had failed to train [or supervise] its employees” on “hand[ling] recurring situations,” creating “an obvious potential for such a violation.” Gillispie v. Miami Twp., No. 23-3999, 2025 WL 1276900, at *5 (6th Cir. May 2, 2025). In addition, the plaintiff must also prove “but-for” causation and proximate causation. See Gambrel, 25 F.4th at 408. Thus, the plaintiff must establish that “proper training [or supervision] would have prevented the constitutional violation” (but-for causation). Id. at 409. The plaintiff must also show that the entity “could reasonably foresee that an employee’s wrongful act would follow from the lack of training [or supervision]” (proximate causation). Id. In support of her § 1983 failure-to-train and failure-to-supervise claim, Adkins points to the following alleged inadequacies: 1) officers received no formal training on LCSO policies; 2) LCSO’s secondary employment policy was disregarded; 3) Stines created a “toxic work environment;” 4) complaints about Fields’s misconduct went ignored; and 5) LCSO did not follow adequate procedures for the report of sexual misconduct complaints. See DE 139 at 5–11, 21–23. The Court will address each argument in turn. First, Adkins alleges that LCSO never formally trained Fields on its policy manual, specifically, its sexual misconduct policy. See DE 139-3. She cites to evidence that Fields merely signed an acknowledgement that he received the policy, rather than read or understood the policies. See DE 139 at 5–6 (citing DE 136-6). She also states that LCSO did not, in any manner, train its officers on its policies. Stines claimed he circulated LCSO policies and “told them to read it and be familiar with it.” DE 135 at 77. Essentially, as to annual training, Stines merely testified that he “[didn’t] recall” whether LCSO conducted any annual trainings on its policies. Id. at 82:24– 83:17. However, in an interrogatory response, Stines affirmed that Fields was “trained” and had “biannual updated training” to maintain his CSO certification, and “was required to be familiar with and follow department policies and procedures” that address “excessive force, abuse of power, sexual contact, sexual abuse and sexual harassment.” DE 143-16 at 2. Fields also confirmed that he reviewed LCSO’s policies. See DE 133 at 49:11–21. As to the sexual misconduct policy, Stines confirmed he could recall “none” in that particular area. DE 135 at 94. Next, Adkins claims that LCSO failed to adhere to its secondary employment policy, which provides that in cases where an LCSO employee seeks to perform “law enforcement duties” for another employer, the secondary employer must secure a permit of approval from LCSO. See DE 139-4 at 1. The employee also must obtain separate written approval for any “outside employment” (“[e]mployment of a non-police nature in which vested police powers are not a condition of employment”) on an annual basis through the chain of command. See id. at 3. Stines testified that he did not “recall” any instances of a secondary employer receiving a permit from LCSO, or an employee seeking approval for outside employment, although in rare instances he gave verbal approval. See DE 135 at 84:3–91:25. Adkins claims that this “dangerous practice” blurred the lines between Fields’s law enforcement duties as CSO with his duties as a home incarceration officer. DE 139 at 8. Notably, “the failure to follow internal policies, without more,” does not constitute a constitutional violation. Winkler v. Madison Cnty., 893 F.3d 877, 891 (6th Cir. 2018). Standing alone, the policy issue has only marginal causation value. Adkins has not submitted any evidence to show that adherence to the secondary employment policy would itself have prevented Fields’s alleged sexual misconduct. Nor has she submitted evidence that LCSO could reasonably foresee that such misconduct would follow from the disregard of that specific policy. Simply, a failure to obtain adequate approvals for secondary employment does not create the “obvious potential” for sexual assault. Still, the secondary employment at issue is not something to be addressed in a vacuum, as the Court later notes. Adkins also argues that Stines fostered a toxic environment at LCSO by exchanging “crude” and “sexist” materials with male deputies, Fields included, see DE 139 at 22, a practice that Stines testified set a “horrible” example as far as “[a]cting unprofessional,” see DE 135 at 136:13–137:1. The materials include graphics of sexual imagery and other sex-related comments sent between various groupings of Stines, Fields, and another LCSO employee via Facebook. See DE 139-6; DE 139-7. Stines is not an individual Defendant, of course, and Adkins tends to discuss this argument and the related allegations as if there were a direct liability claim against Stines. However, Stines was only named in his official capacity, not his personal capacity. Further, though such imagery and comments are unsavory and unprofessional, crude and inappropriate joking between co-workers arguably does not, itself, produce the “obvious potential” that one of those co-workers will commit sexual assault. See Magoffin Cnty. Fiscal Ct., 174 F. App’x at 970 (“The intentional, violent act that a custodian performed far outside the scope of his duties cannot be something that was ‘obvious’ to occur.”). Again, although this is part of the record, it is not to be viewed in isolation under Rule 56. Finally, Adkins’s argument that LCSO ignored complaints regarding Fields presents significant issues for consideration. She relies on two prior reports against Fields: 1) evidence that around August 5, 2021, B.C.’s mother (B.C. being a non-party alleged victim) complained to Stines that Fields refused to let B.C. remain on home incarceration after she rebuffed his sexual advances, but Stines took no action to address the complaint; and 2) evidence that around December 15, 2021, Triplett reported Fields’s sexual abuse of Hill to LCSO via telephone and in person to an unknown employee, but the employee “refused” the report and “laughed at” him. See DE 139 at 10–11. The description of the first report is, at least in the particulars, belied by record. B.C. stated that “[her] mom, she told [Stines], she said, ‘I have to live in this town but you – but I know why he won’t give it to her’” regarding why Fields would not allow B.C. home incarceration. See DE 143-19. The vague and cryptic statement of B.C.’s mother to Stines, presented here only in non- cognizable hearsay form, was not enough to put him on notice of Fields’s potential sexual misconduct. The statement, if made, says nothing about any unwanted physical contact between B.C. and Fields. Stines also denies that B.C.’s mother ever made a report to him about Fields. See DE 135 at 138:1–16. The Court has certain observations about the second report. One, some of the sexual contact between Adkins and Fields predated Triplett’s report, as the contact first started in late November or early December of 2021. See DE 134 at 83:9–16, 89:14–19. Two, the report was made to an “unknown employee,” meaning that there is no evidence that the statement was made to an employee with the requisite “final policymaking authority” as necessary to establish entity liability. See Burgess v. Fischer, 735 F.3d 462, 479 (6th Cir. 2013) (“[A] plaintiff must demonstrate that a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among various alternatives by the official . . . responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in question.”). It is difficult to call notice to a nonspecific employee notice to Stines. At the same time, Stines employed a bespoke complaint process that ignored LCSO policy and essentially would negate notice to an employee from automatically filtering up to him, as Sheriff. And again, there was no training at LCSO, under Stines, on the handling of complaints. Thus, contrary to the written policies at LCSO as described,10 Stines testified that he would personally speak to any individual that had a complaint about a deputy. See DE 135 at 101:8–18; 106:15–22. While he would advise complainants to put any formal complaint in writing, he only ever received verbal complaints. See id. After receiving a verbal complaint, he would speak to the deputy. See id. Stines unequivocally stated, “I am the boss. If anybody comes in to complain, I want to talk to them.” Id. at 101. Although the call is close, upon consideration of the full record and making all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s favor, the Court finds that the matter is triable as to the Sheriff’s liability for Fields’s conduct toward Adkins. Here is why: First, as Sheriff, Stines was a constitutional officer and the chief law enforcement official for the county. See KY. CONST. § 99; see also KRS 70.060 (providing that any sheriff “may command and take with him the power of the county, or a part thereof, to aid him in the execution of the duties of his office”). As such, Stines carried individual decisional power with respect to operations within his administration. He had the authority to train, or not, to enforce written standards, or not, and to affect the de facto status of ostensible policies within his office. For example, LCSO policies required conduct beyond reproach, required specific and detailed annual trainings on various topics (like complaint processes and sexual misconduct), and thoroughly regulated and documented outside or secondary employment by deputies. Stines chose to ignore all of these policies—he performed no local annual or other training, beyond making policies available, and he seemingly took ad hoc approaches to the matters at issue in this case. His email chain conduct set the example, one he called “horrible,” in terms of professionalism in the 10 The policy is at DE 140-1. department. Giving subordinates a policy book is not training on the included subject matter. A law student in receipt of a textbook on civil procedure is not thereby trained in civil procedure. Second, Stines intimately knew the structure and operations of EKCS. He had held the position Fields ultimately took for years. Stines recommended Fields and arguably trained him for EKCS. Thus, he well knew the potential blurred boundaries between the CSO position and home monitoring for EKCS. He knew and arguably approved of Fields meeting supervisees in the courthouse after hours, wearing the deputy uniform and using deputy equipment in the work, and using his LCSO marked vehicle. He further knew that CSO authority was at its apex within the courthouse itself, where Fields had arrest power and would encounter persons under his supervision for EKCS. This, from any objective view, merged the positions and imbued Fields with particular sway and authority in managing the vulnerable supervised population. This was especially true given the way EKCS operated, with little direct involvement or oversight by the geographically remote entity and evident wholesale deference given to the managing employee, Fields, in terms of home incarceration compliance or default. It is notable that in Fields’s false complaint resulting in Adkins’s custody, he alleged that she “failed to report to the Letcher County Sheriff’s Office” and he signed as “LCSo.” DE 139-13. Third, Stines chose to eschew all specific local training, relevant to this case, for his deputies. Despite policy recognition of the need for and primacy of regular and in-service training, Stines implemented no local requirements and merely depended, one charitably infers, on centralized training as part of state officer certification. The Court is not convinced that the generic references to “ethics” or ethical conduct within the Kentucky Administrative Regulations (KAR) rubric fairly addresses the particular risks presented in the local policies or in this case. See DE 143-5 (CSO training rubric, which would cover unspecified “ethical standards”).11 The defense certainly has not proven this at the summary judgment stage. Fourth, although notice to the Sheriff is subject to debate, there certainly was static about Fields that should, in one reasonable view, have prompted institutional inquiry. The key is Triplett’s involvement. He alleges two efforts to alert Stines—one by phone to the department and one in person. Certainly, the defense offers a series of institutional on personnel denials, but Triplett swears he made specific complaints, in December 2021, regarding “the sexual abuse of Ms. Hill by Deputy Fields to the Letcher County Sheriff’s Department.” DE 139-9. He also alleges retaliatory stops and harassment by deputies in the period immediately after the complaint. His allegations—that he registered the conduct, that the employee he spoke to laughed at him and refused to file a report, and that deputies then targeted him—supports an inference that Stines’s policy avoidant complaint approach thwarted effective reporting and allowed the continuation of problematic conduct. In January, after Triplett’s alleged report, Fields, as LCSO complaining witness, targeted Hill through a false criminal complaint designed to hide his malfeasance from the state court. The jury should be allowed to consider Triplett’s efforts to alert Stines’s small department to the abuse.12 Fifth, and most problematically for the Sheriff under the § 1983 rubric, LCSO recognized a grave risk of sexual misconduct by officers and yet Stines intentionally withheld required training on LCSO’s own resultant policies. The recorded LCSO policies appear sound. Thus, the Sexual Misconduct policy (DE 136-5) acknowledges the problem when “an officer abuses . . . authority for sexual purposes.” The policy warns against and forbids Sexual Misconduct including Criminal 11 The Kentucky Law Enforcement Council (KLEC) Code of Ethics, at least as reflected in DE 143-6, does not directly address much of the conduct at issue. 12 The Court will defer consideration of whether B.C.’s reporting theory has any admissible route at trial. Sexual Misconduct, defined as the “abuse of authority by a law enforcement officer for sexual purposes that violate the law.” See id. The policy states, “It is the policy of this Department to train all of their officers concerning the potential for criminal sexual misconduct within law enforcement. . . . ” And what degree of risk did LCSO perceive, via its own policies? LCSO listed the risk as among the “High Risk Critical Tasks” that called for continuous and specific training. See DE 139-5 (Training Directive). Under the Training Directive, several matters qualified as “High Risk Critical Tasks.” One of these was “Sexual harassment/External Sexual Misconduct by Officers.” The “Risk” aspect was “High” because, as the policy itself articulated, such areas are ones “that the final policy maker of the agency knows to a moral certainty that officers will face and . . . the wrong decision with respect to that task will lead to a physical or constitutional injury.” See id. (emphasis added). It often is true in failure-to-train cases, when “rogue employees engage in blatant wrongdoing,” that failure to train on obviously improper conduct either a) will not meet the deliberate indifference standard or b) will eliminate causation tied to absent training. See Gambrel, 25 F.4th at 410-11. Those principles would not square with this record. Stines did not revise the long-standing LCSO policies. Rather, he turned his back on them. The policies recognize, from the viewpoint of the final policy maker (here, the Sheriff), that the risk of sexual misconduct by officers is one that the policy maker “knows to a moral certainty that officers will face.” The policy’s responsible approach is continuous, targeted, rigorous, and documented training. See DE 139-5 at V. Stines’s chosen unilateral approach as Sheriff? He could not recall any training pursuant to the dictates of the training directive. DE 135 at 112-15 (repeatedly answering “Not that I recall” on directive implementation). As to sexual misconduct training, in particular, again, he remembered “None.” There is no proof in the record of specific training by LCSO on any of the pertinent subject matter. Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable inferences and a view of the proof taken in her favor. She offers a supportive expert, who carefully parsed LCSO’s policies and compliance history. That expert, see DE 131-1, noted Stines’s individual unbecoming conduct, his utter failure to follow, train on, or enforce the written policies (to include ethics, sexual misconduct, and citizen complaint processing), and the institutional climate Stines fostered. Ultimately, expert Hilden opined that Stines’s training failures facilitated Fields’s conduct and contributed directly to the harms suffered. This, given LCSO recognition that a problem of this type is a moral certainty, is a plausible explication of the record that the jury is entitled to hear and consider in judging whether the Letcher County Sheriff has direct liability for Fields’s constitutional torts. Certainly, the idea of single-instance liability, under this rubric, is a challenge and rarity. However, as the Sixth Circuit recently explained: To state a claim under this theory, the complaint must allege that a “need for more or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.” Here, liability can be established “based on a single violation of federal rights” when the plaintiff also shows that the municipality\\'s failure to train “present[ed] an obvious potential for a constitutional violation.”. But the plaintiff has the burden of showing two layers of obviousness: “It must be obvious that the failure to train will lead to certain conduct, and it must be obvious (i.e., clearly established) that the conduct will violate constitutional rights.” Martinez v. Wayne Cnty., Michigan, 142 F.4th 828, 844 (6th Cir. 2025) (first citing J.H. v. Williamson Cnty., 951 F.3d 709, 720-21 (6th Cir. 2020); then quoting City of Canton v. Harris, 109 S. Ct. 1197 (1989)). That high hurdle yields to a jury question here, because LCSO’s own in- force policies plainly declared both layers of obvious risk—the incidence of sexual misconduct and the constitutional injury from the “wrong decision.” See DE 139-5. The Training Directive tried to address the stated risk by, as its name proclaims, training. Sheriff Stines, cloaked with full policy power within his department, intentionally chose otherwise. A jury must assess that choice, given the full and nuanced record presented. After all, this is not as stark, for example, as the rogue officer’s forcible rape of an inmate. Rather, Fields plied Adkins with gifts, favors, leniency, and months of text communications, all against a backdrop of conditional liberty. All Defendants in this case lead with the argument of consent. As such, the situational power imbalance and dynamics of home incarceration figure into the factual context and strongly indicate that, just as LCSO’s policy predicted, training may have prevented the misconduct of Fields. Stines facilitated Fields in getting the EKCS job, learning the job, and performing the job. Given all Stines knew about the EKCS structure, Fields’s siloed power, the importance of the courthouse location, and the overlapping duties between the CSO and EKCS function, the Sheriff’s deliberate failure to adhere to the foundational training policies may put the Office on the hook for obvious and materialized risks. The Court denies summary judgment to the Sheriff’s office. b. State Law Claims This leaves Adkins’s state law claims against LCSO. A sheriff’s office is generally protected from tort liability via governmental immunity. See Jones v. Cross, 260 S.W.3d 343, 345 (Ky. 2008). Thus, LCSO is immune from suit on Adkins’s state law claims unless that immunity is waived. See id. KRS § 70.040 provides that “[t]he sheriff shall be liable for the acts or omissions of his deputies; except that, the office of sheriff, and not the individual holder thereof, shall be liable under this section.” KRS § 70.040. Through this provision, a sheriff’s office waives immunity for certain tortious acts or omissions of his deputies. See Jones, 260 S.W.3d at 346. Adkins maintains that LCSO waived immunity from liability pursuant to § 70.040 because Fields “clearly acted within the scope of his official duties.” DE 139 at 17, 24. LCSO disagrees, stating that Fields’s conduct was outside the scope of his duties as a CSO, see DE 136-1 at 13, and regardless, § 70.040 does not apply to CSOs, see DE 143 at 13. Bond v. Carter Cnty., Civil Action No. 14-140-DLB, 2015 WL 3619228 (E.D. Ky. June 9, 2015), a case from this Court, is instructive and persuasive, and the Court adopts its rationale fully here. Bond held that common law vicarious liability principles determine “[w]hat kinds of tortious acts will be imputed to the [sheriff’s office].” Id. at *3. Thus, a sheriff’s office is “only liable for acts of his [deputies] committed in the scope of the employment.” Id. at *4. An act is within a deputy’s scope of employment “where its purpose, however misguided, is wholly or in part to further” the interests of the sheriff’s office. Id. But if the act is done for “purely personal motives” that are “in no way connected with” the interests of the sheriff’s office, that act falls outside of the scope of the deputy’s employment, and the sheriff’s office is not liable. Id. Adkins has not provided any evidence that Fields’s alleged sexual misconduct in any way was done to further the interests of LCSO rather than his own personal sexual interests. “[C]ourts have held that [o]rdinarily, an employer is not vicariously liable for an intentional tort of an employee not actuated by a purpose to serve the employer but motivated, as here, solely by a desire to satisfy the employee’s own sexual proclivities.” Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted). Such is the case here. The purported arrangement between Adkins and Fields—no home incarceration fees or tracking in exchange for sexual favors—did not further the interests of LCSO, and Fields’s conduct was thus outside the scope of his employment. Section 70.040 therefore does not apply, and LCSO is immune from liability on the state tort claims against it. Because the issue of scope is dispositive, the Court need not consider whether § 70.040 applies to conduct of CSOs.13 Accordingly, the Court dismisses the negligence, gross negligence, assault, and battery 13 That the crime Fields committed involved misconduct performed in his “official capacity” does not introduce a conflict. That criminal element goes to the elements of the offense and the abuse of power; the Court does not see the element as implicating the separate scope of employment values that pertain to tort liability or immunity waiver in this context. claims against LCSO. 3. Plaintiffs’ Claims against EKCS EKCS moves to join the summary judgment motions filed by Fields and LCSO. See DE 155. The Court grants the motion to join but finds that its rationale in resolving the motions of the co-defendants does not apply with equal force to EKCS. EKCS is its own entity, separate from LCSO. The claims against it will require analysis of separate (though, predictably, related) evidence. The Court is not responsible for sifting through the record to breathe life into or erect EKCS’s non-existent and functionally distinct arguments. Therefore, the Court denies summary judgment as to Adkins’s § 1983 failure-to-train/supervise claim against EKCS and her state negligent hiring/training/supervision claim against EKCS. Given that Hills’s claims are untimely, and not provable, the Court grants summary judgment for EKCS as to those claims and dismisses them. Moreover, the Court also grants summary judgment as to Adkins’s IIED and NIED claims due to the already described lack of evidence to support those claims. All other claims against EKCS withstand summary judgment and will proceed to trial. IV. Conclusion The Court accordingly ORDERS as follows14: 1. The Court DENIES DE 153; 2. The Court GRANTS DE 155, as to joinder; 3. The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part DE 136 and DE 152; 4. The Claims by Adkins against Fields under § 1983 (Fourteenth Amendment), and assault and battery persist for trial; 14 The Court has endeavored to identify and resolve every pertinent argument. The parties littered the briefing with scores of distinct cases and theories; the decision here concludes all such arguments with a trial to result. 5. The Claims by Adkins against the Sheriff, officially, under § 1983 (Fourteenth Amendment) and failure to train or supervise persist for trial; 6. The Claims by Adkins against EKCS, under § 1983 (Fourteenth Amendment) and for negligence persist for trial; 7. The Court DISMISSES Plaintiff Adkins’s remaining claims with prejudice; 8. The Court DISMISSES Plaintiff Hill’s claims, in their entirety, with prejudice; and 9. By no later than October 6, 2025, the Court ORDERS the parties to file a joint status report setting forth the following: a) anticipated length of trial; b) dates of availability for trial in the first half of 2026; and c) whether the parties intend to engage in mediation and, relatedly, whether the parties would have interest in mediation by the Magistrate Judge.

Nos. 1, 18) (“Petition”). He claims his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(g) and the accompanying forfeiture order on his Bitcoins must be set aside due to: (1) this Court’s lack of jurisdiction, (2) Faulkner’s guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary, (3) ineffective assistance of counsel, and (4) violations of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. Faulkner further argues that equitable tolling applies to the timeliness of the Petition. The Government filed a response opposing the Petition on substantive and procedural grounds (Doc. No. 31), to which Faulkner replied. (Doc. No. 41). For the following reasons, the Court finds neither equitable tolling nor actual innocence warrant addressing the Petition on the merits, and will deny the Petition as untimely.1 I. BACKGROUND On November 2, 2018, Faulkner pled guilty to Engaging in a Child Exploitation Enterprise, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(g). (Case No. 3:17-cr-00044, Doc. No. 107 at 3–5, Doc. No. 1 The Court’s opinion references documents from both the instant action and Faulkner’s criminal case, Case No. 3:17-cr-00044-2. Unless specified otherwise, the docket entry citations refer to this action. 239 at 1). On August 9, 2019, this Court sentenced Faulkner to 420 months of imprisonment, to run concurrently with Faulkner’s sentence of life imposed in the Eastern District of Virginia, Case No. 3:17-cr-00049. (Case No. 3:17-cr-00044, Doc. No. 239 at 3). At the sentencing hearing, the Court advised Faulkner of his appeal rights, stating: Now, Mr. Faulkner, I need to advise you [that] you have the right to appeal. That’s 14 days from when the judgment enters. You’re not going to have a final judgment today until I can do the restitution. But -- in November. If you tell your lawyer you want to appeal, he’ll make sure that happens. If you tell the Clerk of Court you want to appeal, the Clerk will do it for you. And I’m handing you now a blank Notice of Appeal that you can use however you wish, but I strongly urge you to talk to a lawyer. (Case No. 3:17-cr-00044, Doc. No. 267 at 101:11–19). The Court entered the judgment on August 15, 2019. (Case No. 3:17-cr-00044, Doc. No. 239). Faulkner did not timely appeal. On August 12, 2022, more than three years after his sentencing, Faulkner filed his § 2255 petition.2 (Doc. No. 1). He was assigned counsel (Doc. Nos. 9, 10) and filed a supplemental § 2255 petition on July 2, 2024 (Doc. No. 18). II. LEGAL STANDARD Section 2255 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”) provides that a federal prisoner who claims that his sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution, among other things, “may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a). To obtain relief under § 2255, the petitioner must demonstrate constitutional error that had a “substantial and injurious effect or influence on the guilty plea or the jury’s verdict.” Humphress v. United States, 398 F.3d 855, 858 (6th Cir. 2005) (quoting Griffin v. United States, 330 F.3d 733, 736 (6th Cir. 2003)). 2 Faulkner entitled his initial § 2255 filing as a “Second and Successive” petition. (Doc. No. 1). Despite Faulkner’s characterization of his initial filing in this matter as a “second” petition, the Court is unable to locate a prior § 2255 petition filed by Faulkner. Accordingly, the Court will treat Faulkner’s August 23, 2022 filing as his first § 2255 petition. (See Doc. No. 9). III. ANALYSIS The timeliness of the Petition controls the Court’s analysis. Motions under § 2255 must be timely. A one-year statute of limitations period runs from the latest of several triggering dates, including, as relevant here, “the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1). “[W]hen a federal criminal defendant does not appeal to the court of appeals, the judgment becomes final upon the expiration of the period in which the defendant could have appealed to the court of appeals, even when no notice of appeal was filed.” Sanchez-Castellano v. United States, 358 F.3d 424, 427 (6th Cir. 2004). The appeal period is generally 14 days. Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1) (“In a criminal case, a defendant’s notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 14 days after the later of: (i) the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed; or (ii) the filing of the government’s notice of appeal.”). The Court entered its judgment on Faulkner’s criminal case on August 15, 2019. (Case No. 3:17-cr-00044, Doc. No. 239). Faulkner did not file an appeal, so the Court’s judgment became final when the 14-day period to appeal passed. See Sanchez-Castellano, 358 F.3d at 427; Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1). Faulkner’s opportunity to appeal the judgment expired on August 29, 2019, requiring Faulkner to file his Petition by August 29, 2020 for it to be timely. 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1); see United States v. Young, 188 F.3d 510 (6th Cir. 1999) (table) (“The final judgment in a criminal case is the imposition of sentence, and any appeal is postponed until the entry of that judgment.”). Faulkner did not file the Petition until August 12, 2022, nearly two years after his deadline to do so expired.3 (Doc. No. 1 at 17); see 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1). Given Faulkner’s untimely 3 The Court considers the date of the Petition to be the date it was originally filed in the state prison’s mailing system. (Doc. No. 1 at 17); see Towns v. United States, 190 F.3d 468, 469 (6th Cir. 1999) (applying Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, 270–72 (1988) prison mailbox rule in filing, the Government properly raises a statute of limitations defense. McSwain v. Davis, 287 F. App’x 450, 456 (6th Cir. 2008) (the Government has the “initial burden of raising the statute of limitations defense”). Accordingly, the burden shifts to Faulkner, who does not dispute that the Petition is late, to persuade the Court that he is entitled to excusal for his late filing. Id. (citing McClendon v. Sherman, 329 F.3d 490, 494 (6th Cir. 2003) and Griffin v. Rogers, 308 F.3d 647, 653 (6th Cir. 2002)). Faulkner contends that his late filing should be excused because he is entitled to equitable tolling and because he is actually innocent of his convicted crime. (Doc. No. 18 at 26–27). The Court will address each argument in turn. A. Equitable Tolling Faulkner argues that the Court should toll the one-year statute of limitations on the Petition to the date Faulkner filed the Petition. “The doctrine of equitable tolling allows courts to toll a statute of limitations when ‘a litigant’s failure to meet a legally-mandated deadline unavoidably arose from circumstances beyond that litigant’s control.’” Robertson v. Simpson, 624 F.3d 781, 783 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Graham–Humphreys v. Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, Inc., 209 F.3d 552, 560–61 (6th Cir. 2000)) (emphasis added). Faulkner “is ‘entitled to equitable tolling’ only if he shows ‘(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way’ and prevented timely filing.” Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010) (quoting Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 418 (2005)). To determine whether Faulkner has carried his burden, the Court must evaluate whether “the factual allegations are sufficient to support equitable tolling and [must] review the [] court record in order to establish whether [Faulkner’s] assertions are refuted by the record or otherwise without merit.” Ata v. Scutt, determining that the applicable day of prisoner’s filing of a § 2255 motion as the day the inmate signed motion and delivered it to prison mailroom personnel)). 662 F.3d 736, 742 (6th Cir. 2011). Ultimately, equitable tolling is bestowed “sparingly” and is a “fact-intensive inquiry[.]” Robertson, 624 F.3d at 783–84. The Court need only address the second Pace factor—whether there is an extraordinary circumstance that prevented Faulkner’s timely filing—as Faulkner’s inability to demonstrate as much controls here. See Pace, 544 U.S. at 418. On this issue, Faulkner asserts two extraordinary circumstances prevented his timely filing the Petition: (1) the COVID-19 pandemic; and (2) his lawyer’s non-responsiveness in sending him relevant materials for his Petition. Faulkner asserts that based on these extraordinary circumstances, the Court should toll the date that the clock began to run on his Petition from August 2019 to the Fall of 2021. The Government contends this tolling is unwarranted, given the record shows that: Faulkner was able to access the necessary legal materials and documentation to file the Petition in a timely fashion despite the pandemic; Faulkner had roughly seven months prior to the start of the pandemic to prepare his Petition; and no circumstances warrant tolling for nearly two years. (Doc. No. 31 at 7–9). On Faulkner’s first argument, the Court takes Faulkner at his word that the COVID-19 pandemic triggered “severe lockdowns in each of the prisons that housed” him, at least for some time, that likely made his ability to file the Petition more difficult. (Doc. No. 18 at 28). However, notably absent from the record are any announcements or policies from the Bureau of Prisons or other relevant State authorities confirming the duration of lockdowns. Further, the record conclusively reflects that the pandemic restrictions did not continue for so long that Faulkner was unable to file his Petition until nearly two and a half years after COVID-19 began. (See, e.g., Doc. No. 18-2 ¶ 12; Doc. No. 31-7 at 1). Indeed, as the Government emphasizes, Faulkner’s own letter to his former counsel in April 2021 states that his facility was “finally coming off the COVID lockdown.” (Doc. No. 31-7 at 1). Consistent with this, Faulkner acknowledges in his declaration that he had some access to legal resources during the pandemic lockdown, albeit limited in nature. (Doc. No. 18-2 ¶ 12 (Faulkner stating that he had access to six computers in his unit during COVID-19, one of which had Lexis-Nexis, until he started “meaningful work” on his case in Fall 2021)). True, Faulkner’s statements suggest that as late as mid-2021, he was still feeling the impact of COVID-19 while in prison. (See id.). So it is more likely than not that the pandemic may very well justify equitable tolling to some degree, as the cases cited by Faulkner demonstrate, but Faulkner has far from justified that tolling of a year from Fall 2021 is warranted. The cases that Faulkner cites in support do not suggest otherwise, as each provides mere months of tolling relief after the petitioners made tangible showings of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is not present in the record here. See, e.g., Pickens v. Shoop, 2020 WL 3128536, at *2 (S.D. Ohio June 12, 2020) (granting petitioner’s unopposed request to file a petition within 94 days of the COVID-19 state of emergency being lifted, and declining to address any issues of equitable tolling); Cowan v. Davis, 2020 WL 4698968, at *6 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 2020) (tolling habeas petition deadline to November 11, 2020 where there were established facts in the record that COVID-19 pandemic emergency conditions were ongoing); Fitzgerald v. Shinn, 2020 WL 3414700, at *5 (D. Ariz. June 22, 2020) (granting petitioner a 90-day tolling period to file an amended petition, after which it would evaluate COVID-19 and diligence considerations). Indeed, while certainly not required, see United States v. Gabaldon, 522 F.3d 1121, 1126 (10th Cir. 2008), Faulkner could have filed the Petition well-before COVID-19 began, undermining the necessity for any tolling period. See Mims v. United States, 2021 WL 409954, at *3 (E.D. Mo. Feb. 5, 2021) (petitioner asserting inability to access the law library because of COVID-19 was not sufficient for equitably tolling given petitioner failure to show he was diligently pursuing rights prior to COVID); United States v. Thomas, 2020 WL 7229705, at *2–3 (E.D. La. Dec. 8, 2020) (similar); United States v. Barnes, 2020 WL 4550389, at *2 (N.D. Okla. Aug. 6, 2020) (“Even assuming that a lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic delayed defendant’s ability to file his motion, it does not explain the more than one-year delay. COVID- 19 measures have been in effect since March 2020, and defendant could have filed his motion long before March 2020.”). “The bottom line is that the COVID-19 pandemic does not automatically warrant equitable tolling for a petitioner who seeks it on that basis.” United States v. Henry, 2020 WL 7332657, at *4 (W.D. Pa. Dec. 14, 2020). Because Faulkner’s own statements are inconsistent on the impact of COVID-19 on his ability to timely file the Petition, he has failed to show that the pandemic is an extraordinary circumstance warranting tolling for more than two years in this case. See Andrews v. United States, 2017 WL 6376401, at *2 (6th Cir. Dec. 12, 2017) (“Courts have consistently held that general allegations of placement in segregation and lack of access to legal materials are not exceptional circumstances warranting equitable tolling, especially where a petitioner does not sufficiently explain why the circumstances he describes prevented him from timely filing a habeas petition[.]”); see also Chapman-Sexton v. United States, 2021 WL 292027, at *3 (S.D. Ohio Jan. 28, 2021) (“The record does not indicate that impact of any extraordinary circumstances imposed by COVID-19 prevented Petitioner from timely filing this federal habeas corpus petition within the one-year period[.]”). Faulkner’s second argument for equitable tolling, his counsel’s non-responsiveness is an extraordinary circumstance justifying tolling the statute of limitations by roughly two years, is no more persuasive. In support, Faulkner argues that his former counsel prevented him from getting the factual basis for his guilty plea until Summer of 2021, delaying his ability to fully evaluate his double jeopardy and jurisdictional § 2255 arguments. However, review of the record reflects that Faulkner’s former counsel was not so egregiously nonresponsive as to warrant extraordinary circumstances for equitable tolling. Holland, 560 U.S. at 649. Instead, the record shows that Faulkner’s former counsel sent him any materials he, or his mother, requested in a timely fashion. (See, e.g., Doc. No. 31-1 (Faulkner’s mother requesting materials for his § 2255 Petition on January 2, 2020); Doc. No. 31-2 (January 3, 2020 letter from paralegal confirming counsel’s office sent Faulkner § 2255 materials); Doc. Nos. 31-4, 31-5 (showing similar correspondence from March 2020 regarding Faulkner’s Virginia case)). In fact, the record reflects that Faulkner did not request the factual basis for his plea until May 4, 2021, which former counsel sent mere weeks later. (See Doc. No. 31-9). Faulkner’s own lack of diligence in requesting materials he now purports to rely on here does little to reflect his former counsel’s supposed non-responsiveness. This is particularly true where the record indicates his counsel was anything but unavailable to him. Based on the scant evidence before the Court, neither the COVID-19 pandemic, nor his former counsel’s conduct, constitute the rare circumstances in which equitable tolling should be applied to make Faulkner’s nearly two-year tardy Petition timely.4 See Robertson, 624 F.3d at 4 Faulkner argues on reply that he reasonably thought his case was on appeal, and in turn did not realize the statute of limitations on the Petition had passed. The Court need not address the merits of this argument—tenuous in the record as it may be—given that Faulkner waived this argument by not raising it in his opening or amended Petition briefing. (See Doc. No. 18 at 26–30 (not relying on lack of knowledge about counsel failing to file an appeal as grounds for tolling)); see also Sanborn v. Parker, 629 F.3d 554, 579 (6th Cir. 2010); Killian v. United States, 2018 WL 1475607, at *3 (E.D. Tenn. Mar. 26, 2018) (argument about ineffectiveness raised for the first time in a reply brief in support of a motion to vacate waived). In any event, the reason why Faulkner did not file a direct appeal of this Court’s judgment is irrelevant to the threshold question of whether the Petition is timely. To the extent Faulkner believes he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel, the full scope of those facts was known to Faulkner in May 2021 when his counsel informed him that he did not file an appeal. Faulkner’s delay in raising those complaints for more than a year renders any argument on that issue untimely. 783–84 (equitable tolling is applied sparingly). Given this, the Court need not address the second tolling factor and declines to apply equitable tolling to the Petition. B. Actual Innocence Faulkner next contends that the Court should address his Petition on the merits because he is actually innocent of the crime. This is true, he reasons, because his conviction is jurisdictionally invalid. (Doc. No. 18 at 20–21, 26). Under the “miscarriage of justice exception to the AEDPA’s statute of limitations,” the late filing of a petition is excused if the petitioner can show actual innocence. McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 399 (2013). “[T]he threshold inquiry is whether ‘new facts raise[] sufficient doubt about [the petitioner’s] guilt to undermine confidence in the result of the trial [or guilty plea].” Souter v. Jones, 395 F.3d 577, 590 (6th Cir. 2005) (quoting Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 327 (1995)). To establish actual innocence, “a petitioner must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” Schlup, 513 U.S. at 327. In considering this, “[i]t is important to note in this regard that ‘actual innocence’ means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.” Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998). This means that a petitioner must demonstrate that “he factually did not commit the crime.” Hubbard v. Rewerts, 98 F.4th 736, 743 (6th Cir. 2024). At bottom, “the actual innocence exception should ‘remain rare’ and only be applied in the ‘extraordinary case.’” Souter, 395 F.3d at 590 (quoting Schlup, 513 U.S. at 321). The parties dispute whether Faulkner’s argument that his conviction is invalid for jurisdictional reasons is a factual argument, requiring the Court to consider it on the merits, or a legal argument that can be disposed of for untimeliness. On one hand, the Government asserts that courts in this Circuit addressing similar arguments have found it to be of the latter. See Casey v. Tennessee, 399 F. App’x 47, 49 (6th Cir. 2010) (“Even if Casey is correct that the juvenile court’s invalid transfer order entirely deprived the circuit court of jurisdiction to try him as an adult, the ‘new evidence’ he adduces in support of that claim in no way indicates his factual innocence of the crime charged or his lack of competence to stand trial for that charge, bearing instead only on the legal sufficiency of the transfer proceedings.”); King v. Thompson, 2014 WL 1159630, at * 6 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 17, 2014) (following Casey in holding jurisdictional argument does not bear on petitioner’s factual innocence); Justice v. Crews, 2011 WL 7664356, at *3 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 30, 2011) (procedural claim that court lacked subject matter jurisdiction is a claim of legal innocence); Ramos v. Wilson, 2008 WL 2556725, at *6 (N.D. Ohio June 23, 2008) (finding that petitioner’s argument that the state courts that convicted him lacked jurisdiction was not “a claim of factual innocence”). On the other, Faulkner contends that because his jurisdictional argument is rooted in the elements necessary to establish the crime he was convicted of, rather than typical notions of subject matter jurisdiction, it presents a question of factual innocence. Faulkner relies on Waucaush v. United States, 380 F.3d 251, 258 (6th Cir. 2004) to support his position. In Waucaush, “the defendant and his fellow gang members murdered, conspired to murder, and assaulted, with intent to murder, members of rival gangs.” United States v. Henry, 429 F.3d 603, 619 (6th Cir. 2005). “The defendant was convicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which forbids ‘any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.’” Id. (quoting Waucaush, 380 F.3d at 253). In Waucaush, the Sixth Circuit held that “where the enterprise itself did not engage in economic activity”—as was true in that case—and the Government failed to show “a substantial effect on interstate commerce,” the defendant was actually innocent of violating RICO. Waucaush, 380 F.3d at 256–58. According to Faulkner, Waucaush demonstrates that where there is a jurisdictional element of a crime, a defendant is actually innocent when it is not satisfied. Based on his reading, Faulkner asserts that the factual basis for his plea fails to establish the jurisdictional hook required to convict someone of violating 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(g). Accordingly, says Faulkner, this Court’s review of the Petition on the merits is required. See id.; see also United States v. Turner, 272 F.3d 380, 389– 90 (6th Cir. 2001) (“stating that a guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional defenses to an indictment, and holding that “the failure of the government to prove a nexus between the crime and interstate commerce is not jurisdictional in a sense that it deprives the district court of subject matter jurisdiction”). The Court need not decide whether Faulkner’s jurisdictional arguments are factual or legal. Even assuming Faulkner is correct that he makes a factual innocence argument appropriate for tolling purposes, his argument that the jurisdictional requirements under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(g) are not satisfied is unsuccessful. To be convicted of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise (“CEE”) in violation 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(g), the Government must show that the defendant committed specified child exploitation crime(s) “as part of a series of felony violations constituting three or more separate incidents and involving more than one victim, and commits those offenses in concert with three or more other persons.” Id. Faulkner’s conviction is based on three underlying violations of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2). Specifically, that statute prohibits “distribut[ing]” child pornography “using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce” or in a way that is “in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.” Id. The bases of these jurisdictional requirements in 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2) stem from the Commerce Clause. “The Constitution delegates Congress the power ‘[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 553 (1995) (quoting Art. I, § 8, cl. 3). This power is expansive: it is “‘the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed. This power, like all others vested in [C]ongress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution.’” Id. (quoting Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196 (1824)). Still, the commerce power has limits; its scope can be divided into three categories. Id. at 558. “First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.” Id. “Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.” Id. Third, Congress has the “power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce[.]” Id. at 558–59 (citations omitted). According to Faulkner, the jurisdictional hooks implicated in 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2) are the first and third methods of regulating commerce, i.e. regulation of the use of the channels of interstate commerce and regulation of activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce. See Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558–59. Faulkner asserts that the Government cannot establish the required jurisdictional hook because his conduct is that he posted three images from Canada to a website to an anonymous server in Germany; all of which is wholly foreign activity that cannot be regulated by the Commerce Clause. The Government disagrees, noting that Faulkner admitted to acting in concert with individuals in the United States to share and trade child sexual abuse material (“CSAM”), making Faulkner’s conduct substantially related to interstate commerce. (Case 3:17-cr-00044-2, Doc. No. 311, 18, 20–21). Based on the record, the Court agrees with the Government because Faulkner admitted to acting in concert with individuals in the United States to commit violations of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2). Thus the predicate for his 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(g) conviction moots his actual innocence argument. When Faulkner pled guilty, he admitted to acting in concert with United States residents, including “co-defendants Patrick Dane Falte, Andrew Ryan Leslie, Brett Allen Bedusek, and with other members of ‘Website A’ as a part of a series of felony violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 2251(d)(1)(A) and 2252(a)(2), prohibiting the advertisement and distribution of child pornography.” (Case 3:17-cr-00044-2, Doc. No. 311 at 18–21). “Generally[,] the cases show that jurisdiction exists to try one who is a conspirator, whenever the conspiracy is in whole or in part carried on in the country whose laws are conspired against.” Ford v. United States, 273 U.S. 593, 621–22 (1927). Given this, courts have “jurisdiction over a conspiracy and all those proved to be conspirators if the conspiracy is designed to have criminal effects within the United States and if there is sufficient proof that at least one of the conspirators committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy within” a court’s jurisdiction. United States v. Winter, 509 F.2d 975, 982 (5th Cir. 1975). Because of Faulkner’s factual admission, he cannot meaningfully dispute that the record demonstrates that Faulkner admitted that those in his conspiracy committed acts in furtherance of the conspiracy within this Court’s jurisdiction and within the scope of Congress’s power to regulate commerce embedded in 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2). Faulkner’s other admitted conduct demonstrates why this Court has jurisdiction of Faulkner’s underlying 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2) violations. Faulkner and his co-defendants arranged for their criminal enterprise to have criminal effects in the United States through: (1) co-defendant Falte, a resident of the Middle District of Tennessee, creating “Website A” (Doc. No. 3:17-cr- 00044-2, Doc. No. 328 ¶¶ 1, 6–10); and (2) Faulkner assisting Falte with the management of “Website A” by, for example, approving users for membership and reviewing and approving posts and maintaining a public key cryptography system (Case No. 3:17-cr-00044-2, Doc. No. 311 at 15). Winter, 509 F.2d at 982. Faulkner’s co-defendants also committed overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy within this Court’s jurisdiction, as they advertised and distributed the CSAM from within the United States (Case No. 3:17-cr-00044-2, Doc. No. 311 at 16–18; Case No. 3:17- cr-00044-2, Doc. No. 328 ¶¶ 18, 21). See Winter, 509 F.2d at 982. Indeed, in each of the three underlying 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2) violations of Faulkner’s involvement in the CEE that led to his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(g)—distribution of child pornography on September 14, 2015, September 30, 2015, and March 27, 2016—Faulkner made a post on “Website A.” (See Case No. 3:17-cr-00044-2, Doc. No. 311 at 21). In doing so, he made the messages accessible to anyone in the United States, including Faulkner’s co-defendants, as they intended. (See id.). The record shows that Faulkner’s criminal activity falls well within the reach of Congress’s commerce power, as articulated under Lopez.5 Given this, even if Faulkner is correct that his jurisdictional argument is factual rather than legal, he has failed to demonstrate that he is actually innocent of his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(g) such that the Court must address the Petition on its merits. Accordingly, Faulkner’s Petition will be denied, and his conviction will remain in place. C. No Evidentiary Hearing is Necessary. Faulkner requests a hearing to determine whether his former counsel failed to timely file an appeal of his conviction in contravention of his instruction to do so. (Doc. No. 18 at 22). The Court is required to hold a hearing where the petitioner raises a factual dispute underlying his claims. See Martin v. United States, 889 F.3d 827, 832 (6th Cir. 2018). Faulkner does not dispute 5 The Government also argues that Faulkner’s conviction can be sustained on alternative grounds, i.e., that Faulkner committed predicate offenses not named in the Indictment. (Doc. No. 31 at 15). Because the Court finds that Faulkner pleading guilty to the predicate offenses named in the Indictment sustains his conviction, it need not reach this issue. that the facts supporting this theory were discoverable and disclosed no later than May 26, 2021, when Faulkner’s trial counsel wrote to explain that no notice of appeal had been filed. (Doc. No. 31 at 7–8; see Doc. No. 31-9). Despite being on notice then that his appeal was not filed, Faulkner failed to prove there were extraordinary circumstances preventing him from filing a timely Petition on this basis. See supra, Section III.A. The record demonstrates that the Petition is untimely, and Faulkner has not raised “sufficiently specific allegations [that] would entitle [him] to equitable tolling,” making a hearing addressing the merits of the Petition is unnecessary. Ata, 662 F.3d at 742, 742 n.6. D. Certificate of Appealability Finally, a Certificate of Appealability (“COA”) may issue “only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.” Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336 (2003). Where, as here, the denial of a petition is based on procedural grounds, “a COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.” Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000). Because “jurists of reason would [not] find it debatable whether” this Court is correct in its procedural ruling that equitable tolling does not apply to the Petition, a COA will not issue. Id. IV. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, Faulkner’s Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence in Accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (Doc. No. 1) and Supplemental Motion (Doc. No. 18) will be denied. Further, a COA will not issue. Slack, 529 U.S. at 484. An appropriate order will enter. WAVERLY D. AS. Co JR.

Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit. 2 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 3 of 31 MATTHEW MADDOX, District Judge (sitting by designation): On August 20, 2020, James C. Jones, Jr. was indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia for tax-related offenses. An eight-count superseding indictment was filed on September 15, 2023, charging Jones with violations of 26 U.S.C. §§ 7201, 7206(1), and 7212(a). On November 21, 2023, Jones was convicted by a jury on all counts of the superseding indictment. The matter proceeded to sentencing on May 7, 2024. The district court determined that Jones’s Sentencing Guidelines range was 63 to 78 months of imprisonment, based in part on two two-level increases to Jones’s offense level under U.S.S.G. § 2T1.1(b)(1) and (b)(2), to which Jones objected. Jones was sentenced to a total prison term of 78 months and supervised release for a total period of three years. The district court also imposed a fine of $250,000 and ordered restitution in the amount of $394,508. Jones now challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in support of his convictions and challenges application of U.S.S.G. § 2T1.1(b)(1) to compute his Sentencing Guidelines range. Additionally, the parties agree that the district court committed a Rogers error that warrants resentencing. For reasons stated below, we affirm Jones’s convictions as founded upon sufficient evidence and proper application of the challenged Sentencing Guidelines enhancement, and we vacate Jones’s sentence and remand to remedy the Rogers error. I. James C. Jones, Jr. was the owner and president of Lifeline Ambulance Service, Inc. (“Lifeline”), a Subchapter S corporation in Virginia, from the late 1980s until the business ceased operation sometime around 2010. Lifeline was required to withhold taxes from the 3 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 4 of 31 wages of its employees, hold them in trust, and pay them over to the federal government. In 2008 and 2009, Jones withheld employment taxes from the wages of Lifeline employees and filed employment tax forms with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) but did not pay Lifeline’s employment taxes to the IRS. In May 2009, IRS Revenue Officer Susan Meador began contacting Jones, attempting to collect the delinquent employment taxes from Lifeline necessary to bring the company into compliance. On May 27, 2009, Meador had a Trust Fund Recovery Penalty (“TFRP”) interview with Jones. Jones withheld information and made false statements about his assets in an IRS Form 433-B, Collection Information Statement for Business, and signed this form under penalties of perjury. In June 2009, following the TRFP interview, the IRS determined that Jones was independently liable for the unpaid trust fund taxes,1 which amounted to $186,519.55. Upon making this assessment, Meador requested financial and other information from Jones to ascertain his ability to pay the delinquent employment taxes and the TFRP. On October 12, 2010, Jones completed IRS Form 433- A, Collection Information Statement for Wage Earners and Self-Employed Individuals, which omitted the fact that he owned high-value cars and real estate, including five luxury apartments on the Dutch Caribbean island of St. Maarten. Jones also omitted the rental income he received from these properties and the offshore real estate holding companies associated with them. The Form 433-A that Jones completed was contradicted by a 1 “Trust fund taxes” refers to employment taxes held from employees by the employer in trust to be paid over to the IRS. See J.A. 7515. 4 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 5 of 31 statement of affairs provided to a bank in St. Maarten earlier in 2010, when he reported assets—including his cars and real estate—which totaled over $14.5 million in value. He also listed his holding companies on the statement of affairs. In addition, Jones owned commercial property in Richmond, Virginia (the “Aspen Avenue property”) and Christiansburg, Virginia (the “Bell Road property”) that he did not report on the Form 433-A. The Bell Road property was listed on the statement of affairs submitted to the bank in St. Maarten. Jones transferred the Aspen Avenue and Bell Road properties out of his name while the IRS attempted to collect the unpaid employment taxes. Jones sold the Aspen Avenue property for $1,075,000 in July 2009. He paid $599,920 of the proceeds to Marine Holding, a St. Maarten corporation controlled by real estate developer Luis Gioia. Jones also transferred the Bell Road property from his holding company Falling Branch Properties, LLC (“Falling Branch”) to Marine Holding. During the transfer of the property, Jones provided his closing attorney paperwork stating that he borrowed $400,000 from auto dealer Dana Mecum and that Marine Holding had acquired that loan. The paperwork indicated that Marine Holding would take ownership of the property in satisfaction of the loan. However, Mecum never loaned Jones $400,000, and the deed of trust presented at the closing was forged. The paperwork Jones provided— purportedly signed by Tony Cabeceira as chief financial officer—listed an address for Marine Holding in Miami, Florida. But Marine Holding had no Miami office, Cabeceira was not its chief financial officer, and he never authorized or signed those documents. Jones provided a false document concerning the transfer of the Bell Road property to IRS Officer Meador during the agency’s collection efforts in 2010. He later gave several false 5 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 6 of 31 documents to Special Agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, including a Mecum promissory note and false real estate documents involving Marine Holding. In 2017, Jones was subpoenaed by a grand jury to produce records of any foreign bank accounts that he owned or controlled within the previous five years. Jones responded to the subpoena through his attorney stating that he did not have any records to provide. The government even clarified to Jones that he had an obligation not only to turn over documents in his possession, but also retrieve them from any foreign bank accounts that he controlled. At Jones’s direction, his attorney responded by email falsely claiming that Jones still had nothing to provide. At the time of this response, Jones owned or controlled at least five foreign bank accounts. In addition, Jones filed false personal tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2018. The personal tax returns contained several falsehoods, including claimed large business casualty and theft losses of over $2.4 million and claimed losses related to Jones’s divorce exceeding $1.4 million, and falsely omitted rental income from his St. Maarten properties. On September 15, 2023, a grand jury sitting in the Western District of Virginia returned the modified superseding indictment charging Jones in eight counts: Count One, corruptly endeavoring to obstruct the IRS in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a); Count Two, tax evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7201; and Counts Three through Eight, filing false individual tax returns, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1). The matter proceeded to a jury trial beginning on November 14, 2023. On November 21, 2023, the jury found Jones guilty on all counts. 6 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 7 of 31 II. On appeal, Jones argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support convictions on the eight counts of the superseding indictment. “A defendant who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence ‘must overcome a heavy burden.’” United States v. Robinson, 855 F.3d 265, 268 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting United States v. Hoyte, 51 F.3d 1239, 1245 (4th Cir. 1995)). We review such challenges by determining “whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” United States v. Collins, 412 F.3d 515, 519 (4th Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Fisher, 912 F.2d 728, 730 (4th Cir. 1990)). The court considers “‘all the evidence considered by the jury, both admissible and inadmissible’ when assessing a sufficiency challenge.” United States v. Huskey, 90 F.4th 651, 662 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting United States v. Simpson, 910 F.2d 154, 159 (4th Cir. 1990)). The jury’s verdict “must be upheld” if “substantial evidence” supports it—that is, “‘evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support’ the defendant’s guilt.” United States v. Banker, 876 F.3d 530, 540 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting United States v. Young, 609 F.3d 348, 355 (4th Cir. 2010)). Witness credibility is not reviewed; and we assume that the jury resolved all credibility disputes and testimonial contradictions in favor of the government. See Huskey, 90 F.4th at 662. Reversal for insufficient evidence is “limited to ‘cases where the prosecution’s failure is clear.’” United States v. Spirito, 36 F.4th 191, 200 (4th Cir. 2022) (citation omitted). A defendant who prevails on a challenge to the sufficiency of the 7 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 8 of 31 evidence is “entitled to a judgment of acquittal without further proceeding.” Huskey, 90 F.4th at 662. We shall address the sufficiency of the evidence in support of Counts Three through Eight before proceeding to address Counts One and Two. A. 1. Jones first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in support of his convictions for filing false income tax returns, as charged in Counts Three through Eight of the superseding indictment. These counts charge Jones with filing a false individual tax return for each tax year from 2013 through 2018, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1). J.A. 183– 84. Each count corresponds with a tax year for which Jones filed the false return (i.e., Count Three for tax year 2013; Count Four for 2014; Count Five for 2015; Count Six for 2016; Count Seven for 2017; Count Eight for 2018). Id. An individual violates § 7206(1) if he or she “[w]illfully makes and subscribes any return, statement, or other document, which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter[.]” 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1). A breach of federal tax laws is “willful” if there was a “voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty.” Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192, 201, 111 S. Ct. 604, 610, 112 L. Ed. 2d 617 (1991). “Intent may be inferred from conduct, and willfulness in a criminal tax case may be established by a consistent pattern of not reporting income or inconsistently reporting income.” United States v. Mathews, 761 F.3d 891, 893 (8th Cir. 2014) (citation modified); see also United 8 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 9 of 31 States v. Diamond, 788 F.2d 1025, 1030 (4th Cir. 1986) (“[D]irect evidence of intent . . . is of course seldom possible and never a requisite to finding the necessary culpability of mind beyond a reasonable doubt.”). Jones does not contest the sufficiency of the government’s evidence at trial that his “personal tax returns for the years 2013 through 2018 contained improper deductions and failed to disclose income from properties in St. Maarten.” Appellant Br. At 18. Jones focuses his challenge on the sufficiency of evidence that he acted willfully and with knowledge that the tax returns were improper. The government argues that the trial evidence was more than sufficient to show that Jones willfully submitted false personal tax returns to the IRS for tax years 2013 through 2018. Appellee Br. at 19. The government points out that the trial evidence established that Jones failed to report substantial income from his rental properties for the charged tax years, used a nominee company director to evade discovery that he owned the properties, falsely claimed the casualty or theft loss from his divorce judgment, and improperly reported embezzlement losses; that his testimony was implausible and false; and that he took affirmative acts in the years before filing the false tax returns to evade the payment of employment taxes. Viewing the trial evidence in its totality, we find the evidence of willfulness presented at trial to be sufficient. First, the amount of rental income from Jones’s rental properties in St. Maarten that he failed to disclose in each of the charged tax returns was substantial. In statements of affairs Jones submitted to a bank in St. Maarten, which were presented at trial, Jones reported rental income from properties in St. Maarten totaling $196,236 in 2014 and $196,236 in 2016. J.A. 1337, 1368. In addition, the IRS determined from the available 9 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 10 of 31 evidence the amounts of rental income these properties generated each year that Jones failed to report it in his tax return. IRS agent Jennifer Maroulis testified at trial that, based on her calculations, the properties generated between $120,000 and $170,750 in rental income each year from 2013 through 2016, $70,100 in 2017, and $29,600 in 2018. J.A. 7523–25; S.A. 001. Thus, a substantial amount of income was generated by the St. Maarten properties, and none of it was reported in Jones’s personal income tax returns spanning several years. See generally J.A. 4463–5157. In sum, Jones reported substantial rental income to the St. Maarten bank while repeatedly omitting it from his tax returns. A rational juror could infer, from this evidence, that Jones was aware of this substantial income and that his failure to report it in his tax returns was intentional. Second, the government established at trial that Jones hired an offshore nominee company director for the St. Maarten properties and took other steps that had the effect of concealing Jones as the beneficial owner of the properties. The director, Hans Pfennings, testified that Jones hired Pfennings and his management companies to manage the companies through which Jones owned his real estate. Pfennings’s job as management director of the companies was to “set up the corporation and open a bank account and do . . . day-to-day-management, and keep the company in good standing, and file the tax returns if required.” J.A. 6909:6–9. Pfennings, through his St. Maarten-based management company Chartwell, managed a number of Jones’s real-estate companies, each of which owned property in St. Maarten. J.A. 6912. Antonio Cabecceira, a St. Maarten-based commercial banking officer and business associate of Pfennings, testified that as “managing director [Pfennings] would have to sign for . . . anything that was done within 10 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 11 of 31 the company.” J.A. 6743–44. However, Pfennings’s testimony made clear that he had no decision-making authority respecting the properties but rather followed Jones’s instructions. J.A. 6962–66. Trial evidence established that Jones directed Chartwell to issue bearer shares for some of his companies. J.A. 6087, 6912, 6915, 6931. The actual owner of bearer shares is not registered anywhere. The share is “embodied in a bearer share certificate” such that anyone in possession of the certificate is a shareholder of the entity. J.A. 6915. Thus, Jones’s hiring of an offshore nominee company director for the St. Maarten properties and issuance of bearer shares both tended to conceal his identity as the beneficial owner of the properties and, therefore, offered support for a rational finding that he acted willfully in failing to disclose income from the properties in his tax returns. Third, during his testimony at trial, Jones denied ownership of the properties in St. Maarten, offered minimal explanation for documentary evidence to the contrary, and denied signing documents that bore his signature. See, e.g., J.A. 7677, 7693–94, 7701–03. Jones testified that other trial witnesses were lying, including Gioia, see J.A. 7758–59, who testified that Jones had bought several St. Maarten properties from him, J.A. 6997. Considered in light of other testimony Jones provided that was contradicted by documentary evidence and testimony from multiple witnesses, Jones’s testimony about the properties in St. Maarten could be found by a rational juror to be false, lending support to a finding that Jones willfully avoided reporting his rental income from the properties. See United States v. Burgos, 94 F.3d 849, 868 (4th Cir. 1996) (en banc) (“A defendant’s credibility is a material consideration in establishing guilt, and if a defendant ‘take[s] the stand . . . and denies the charges and the jury thinks he’s a liar, this becomes evidence of 11 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 12 of 31 guilt to add to the other evidence.’”) (quoting United States v. Zafiro, 945 F.2d 881, 888 (7th Cir. 1991), aff’d, 506 U.S. 534, 113 S. Ct. 933, 122 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1993)). Fourth, the government established at trial that, on IRS Form 4684 for tax year 2013, Jones improperly reported a business casualty loss of $1,405,376 he was required to pay in a divorce settlement. J.A. 5101. The relevant section of Form 4684, Section B, instructs taxpayers to report the amounts of losses and damages to businesses and income-producing property they own. The $1.4 million loss reported on Jones’s Form 4684 is listed as a loss for his holding company Falling Branch. Id. During his testimony at trial, however, Jones admitted that the $1.4 million loss was based on a divorce settlement or judgment against him, which Jones admitted he never paid. J.A. 7709–10. Any rational juror could conclude, based on their common sense, that Jones’s listing of this amount as a casualty loss to Falling Branch on the Form 4684 was improper. Fifth, the government established at trial that Jones improperly reported substantial embezzlement losses to Lifeline on the same 2013 Form 4684. During the divorce proceedings, Jones sued his ex-wife, Karen Peterson-Jones, for embezzlement. J.A. 7444. The embezzlement suit was dismissed around August 2010. J.A. 7445. During trial in the instant case, Petersen-Jones testified that she never embezzled money from Lifeline. Id. A rational juror could accept this testimony as evidence that Jones never sustained losses from embezzlement. Further, Jones received professional advice not to claim a deduction for the alleged embezzlement losses. Jones’s accountant Jim Patton testified that he prepared Jones’s corporate tax returns and, during discussions with Jones, told him that he could not include 12 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 13 of 31 the alleged embezzlement losses on the corporate tax return for Lifeline because, “if you report on the cash basis, you may not take a deduction for the embezzlement of income you have not reported.” J.A. 7255–56. Jones had other communications with Patton’s office on the topic, including emails advising Jones that embezzlement losses are deductible “in the year the theft is discovered[,]” J.A. 7256, and “if the amounts have previously been reported in income[,]” J.A. 7257. In the latter email, Jones was specifically advised that “no amount ha[d] ever been taxed which could subsequently be written off.” Id. While Jones concedes that Patton advised him not to claim the embezzlement losses on his corporate return, he argues that Patton did not “unequivocally” tell Jones not to claim the losses on his personal return. Appellant Br. 18. But in another email, Jones confirmed his understanding that he could not claim the embezzlement losses on his personal tax return, based on a discussion with an employee in Patton’s office. J.A. 7259. Despite this advice, Jones reported embezzlement losses of $151,578.96 for Lifeline on his personal Form 4684 for tax year 2013, several years after discovering the alleged losses. J.A. 5101. Any rational juror could find that Jones acted willfully in improperly listing these alleged losses as a casualty loss based on his communications with Patton and his office. Finally, the jury could rely on Jones’s affirmative acts to evade the payment of employment taxes as evidence of his willfulness in filing false returns for tax years 2013 through 2018. In United States v. Abboud, the Sixth Circuit held that “evidence that Defendants willfully violated the tax laws with respect to the payment of employees was probative as to Defendants’ willfulness in connection with the failure to file a tax return and the underreporting of income.” 438 F.3d 554, 582 (6th Cir. 2006); see also United 13 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 14 of 31 States v. Bok, 156 F.3d 157, 165 (2d Cir. 1998) (“[A] defendant’s past taxpaying record is admissible to prove willfulness circumstantially.”). Here, the government presented evidence that Jones had been committing affirmative acts of tax evasion since 2009.2 Based on the totality of the foregoing evidence, any rational juror could find Jones to have acted willfully in failing to report substantial rental income generated from his properties in St. Maarten and claiming improper deductions in his tax returns. The substantial amount of the unreported rental income and the fact that he reported rental income to the bank in St. Maarten, combined with actions he took that effectively concealed his beneficial ownership of the St. Maarten properties, support a reasonable inference that Jones knew his omission of the income in his tax returns was false and unlawful. The substantial size of improper deductions Jones claimed for embezzlement losses he never sustained and a divorce settlement or judgment he never paid, combined with Patton’s testimony that Jones was advised not to claim the embezzlement losses, support a reasonable finding that Jones acted willfully in claiming the improper deductions. The jury’s finding of willfulness is further bolstered by evidence of Jones’s history evading tax obligations. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that sufficient evidence was presented to support Jones’s convictions for violating 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1) as charged in Counts Three through Eight. 2 The evidence of Jones’s affirmative acts of tax evasion that preceded his filing of false individual income tax returns is discussed in greater detail in Part II.A.2 infra. 14 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 15 of 31 2. Jones argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to show that, after August 14, 2014 (within the six-year limitations period),3 Jones corruptly obstructed or endeavored to obstruct an IRS proceeding in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a), as alleged in Count One, or that he committed an affirmative act of tax evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7201, as alleged in Count Two. Regarding Count One, an individual violates 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a) by “either 1) ‘corruptly’ or ‘by force or threats of force’ endeavoring to ‘intimidate or impede’; or by 2) ‘in any other way corruptly or by force or threats of force’ impeding administration of the tax laws.” United States v. Bostian, 59 F.3d 474, 477 (4th Cir. 1995) (quoting 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a)). This Court has interpreted the second clause, called the “omnibus clause,” broadly to encompass multi-faceted schemes to gain an improper benefit or advantage or to evade payment of taxes. See United States v. Mitchell, 985 F.2d 1275, 1279 (4th Cir. 1993); Bostian, 59 F.3d at 478–79. Actions taken corruptly to impede the administration of tax laws need not be independently unlawful to violate § 7212(a). Bostian, 59 F.3d at 478–79 (citing Mitchell, 985 F.2d at 1278). With respect to Count Two, “[i]n order to establish a violation of 26 U.S.C.A. § 7201, the government must prove: 1) that the defendant acted willfully; 2) that the defendant committed an affirmative act that constituted an attempted evasion of tax 3 The applicable statute of limitations for both § 7201 and § 7212(a) violations is six years. See 26 U.S.C. § 6531(2) and (6). 15 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 16 of 31 payments; and 3) that a substantial tax deficiency existed.” United States v. Wilson, 118 F.3d 228, 236 (4th Cir. 1997) (citing United States v. Goodyear, 649 F.2d 226, 227–28 (4th Cir. 1981)); see also Sansone v. United States, 380 U.S. 343, 351, 85 S. Ct. 1004, 1010, 13 L. Ed. 2d 882 (1965). A “willful attempt” to evade may be inferred from “any conduct having the likely effect of misleading or concealing.” Wilson, 118 F.3d at 236 (quoting Goodyear, 649 F.2d at 228); see also Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492, 499, 63 S. Ct. 364, 368, 87 L. Ed. 418 (1943). Evidence proving willful tax evasion is ordinarily circumstantial, since direct proof is often unavailable. Circumstantial evidence in this context may consist of, among other things, a failure to report a substantial amount of income, a consistent pattern of underreporting large amounts of income, the spending of large amounts of cash that cannot be reconciled with the amount of reported income, or any conduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal. United States v. Thompson, 518 F.3d 832, 850–51 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Kim, 884 F.2d 189, 192 (5th Cir.1989)). Throughout the period between 2009 and 2019, Jones was aware that there was a substantial deficiency of employment taxes that Lifeline failed to pay and that the IRS was seeking to collect those taxes. IRS Revenue Officer Meador began attempting to collect the delinquent employment taxes in May 2009. J.A. 6231–35. Her efforts included visiting Lifeline’s offices and conducting a TFRP interview with Jones. During the meeting, Meador made clear that she was attempting to collect delinquent taxes “for the first, second, and third quarter of 2008.” J.A. 6242. Further, Meador testified that Jones was aware that the taxes were delinquent.” Id. When questioned during the interview about why the 16 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 17 of 31 employment taxes were delinquent, Jones stated that he was not able to pay because “Medicaid and Medicare payments stopped, and that it was the high price of diesel fuel.” Id. In June 2009, the IRS eventually assessed Jones with a TFRP, which made him liable for the unpaid taxes. J.A. 5877–80, 6251–55. Therefore, Jones was aware of the substantial tax deficiency and the IRS’s efforts to collect the unpaid taxes. Substantial evidence was presented at trial to support reasonable findings that, within the applicable limitations period, Jones took several acts to evade the payment of employment taxes the federal government sought to collect from him. First, evidence presented at trial established that Jones directed false responses to a grand jury subpoena he received in October 2017 seeking records of his foreign bank accounts for the prior five years. J.A. 646–52, 7166–68, 7172–75. Through his attorney, Jones consistently responded that he did not have any responsive bank records to provide, even after the government clarified that he was required to retrieve responsive records from the banks. J.A. 653, 7172–75. Jones never produced responsive records. J.A. 7175. During trial, the government presented substantial documentary evidence and testimony that Jones owned or controlled at least five foreign bank accounts during the relevant period. J.A. 923–26, 6044, 6061–62, 6104–05, 6149–50, 6165–66, 6172–74, 6913–14, 6934–36, 6946, 6955–56, 6961–65, 7206–11. Any rational juror could conclude from this evidence that Jones’s statements to the government were false and made intentionally and with knowledge of their falsity, and that they impeded the federal government’s tax collection efforts. 17 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 18 of 31 Second, as explained in Part II.A.1 supra, trial evidence established that Jones was responsible for filing a series of false individual income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2018, and that he did so willfully. Jones’s ownership of significant offshore assets and receipt of rental income from properties in St. Maarten were falsely omitted from each of these returns. A rational juror could conclude from evidence of the IRS’s efforts to collect the unpaid employment taxes that Jones’s concealment of his foreign assets and rental income impeded the IRS’s collection efforts. A rational juror could conclude that, by concealing his ownership of, and rental income from, high-value properties in St. Maarten, Jones willfully attempted to avoid payment of tax obligations that were outstanding at the time the false tax returns were filed. At trial, the jurors were presented substantial evidence that Jones acted willfully in attempting to evade payment of taxes and acted corruptly in impeding the federal government’s collection efforts. Evidence that Jones acted willfully and corruptly after August 2014 (within the limitations period) included actions he took before August 2014 to avoid paying the tax liability and to impede the government’s collection efforts. Shortly after the IRS began collection efforts in May 2009 and assessed Jones with a penalty in June 2009, Jones transferred properties he owned in Virginia out of his name. In connection with these transactions, Jones caused a fraudulent transfer of $599,920 to Marine Holding, J.A. 7036–38, and provided false documentation that Marine Holding acquired a $400,000 loan Jones claimed to owe to Dana Mecum, J.A. 6377–82, which 18 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 19 of 31 Mecum testified never existed, J.A. 6712–13.4 The documentation listed a false address for Marine Holding; contained a forged signature for Tony Cabeceira, which Cabeceira testified was a forgery and misspelled his name; and identified Cabeceira as Marine Holding’s chief financial officer, which Cabeceira testified he was not. J.A. 6713–16, 6740, 6760, 6803, 6807–13, 7053–55, 7151–61. Marine Holding’s CEO, Luis Gioia, testified that Marine Holding was not involved in any transfers of Jones’s Virginia properties, and he never signed or authorized any documents for these transactions. J.A. 7050–57. Jones provided false documentation of the Bell Road and Aspen Avenue property transactions to Meador in response to her collection efforts and, later, to Special Agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation during their criminal investigation. J.A. 608–28, 1128–57, 1144–50, 6812– 13, 7053–55. In October 2010, Jones completed and gave Meador an IRS Form 433-A in which he omitted his ownership of the luxury properties in St. Maarten and the rental income he received from the properties, as well as his ownership of high-value cars and valuable commercial property in Virginia. J.A. 5895–900. Trial evidence established that these omissions were false. A statement of affairs Jones provided to a St. Maarten bank in May 2010 reflected assets totaling more than $14 million, including several properties in St. Maarten generating substantial rental income, the holdings companies through which Jones owned these properties, and 30 cars with a total value of over $1.8 million. J.A. 1313–16. 4 Mecum, an auto dealer, testified that a wire transfer he made to Jones was not a loan but was instead part of a payment for cars Mecum sold for Jones. J.A. 6710–13. 19 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 20 of 31 As explained in Part II.A.1 supra, Jones took actions that tended to conceal the fact that he was the beneficial owner of properties and bank accounts in St. Maarten. In or around 2007, Jones hired a nominee company director to complete all documentation and issue bearer shares for companies through which Jones owned the St. Maarten properties, which hid Jones’s ownership of the companies and properties while he retained control and collected rent. J.A. 6915. In addition, while testifying at his trial, Jones continued to deny ownership of the companies, properties, and bank accounts in St. Maarten, claimed that he paid Lifeline’s employment taxes, denied owning a collection of high-value cars, and denied signing the documents reflecting his ownership of various assets, J.A. 7677–78, 7685, 7689, 7693–95, 7701–03, all in the face of substantial testimony and documentary evidence to the contrary, see J.A. 1313–16, 1666–69, 6061, 6766–69, 6913–14, 6946–47, 6952. Considering all of the documentary evidence and testimony from other witnesses that tended to disprove Jones’s testimony, a rational juror could conclude that Jones’s testimony was false and given intentionally to impede the administration of tax laws. In its totality, the foregoing evidence reflects a pattern of deceptive, clandestine, and obstructive conduct by Jones in response to the IRS’s efforts to collect a tax liability for which he was responsible. Any rational juror could conclude from this evidence that Jones acted willfully and corruptly in support of a scheme to evade payment of Lifeline’s unpaid employment taxes. We conclude, therefore, that the trial evidence was sufficient to support Jones’s conviction on Counts One and Two of the superseding indictment. 20 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 21 of 31 III. Next, Jones challenges his sentence as procedurally unreasonable, arguing that the district court improperly increased his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2T1.1(b)(1). “In reviewing whether a sentencing court properly applied the Guidelines, this Court ‘reviews the [sentencing] court’s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.’” United States v. Henderson, 88 F.4th 534, 536 (4th Cir. 2023) (quoting United States v. Allen, 446 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir. 2006)). “Improper calculation of [the] advisory sentencing range under the Guidelines constitutes significant procedural error, making [the] sentence procedurally unreasonable” and subject to vacatur. United States v. Clay, 627 F.3d 959, 970 (4th Cir. 2010). “The government bears the burden of establishing the applicability of a sentencing enhancement by the preponderance of the evidence.” Henderson, 88 F.4th at 536. To determine Jones’s Sentencing Guidelines range, the district court grouped all counts of conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(b). J.A. 7919. The district court began with a base offense level of 22 pursuant to §§ 2T1.1(a)(1) and 2T4.1(I) because the offenses involved tax evasion and the filing of false tax returns, and the total tax loss, which included the unpaid employment taxes and the fraudulent deductions, was more than $1.5 million but not more than $3.5 million. J.A. 7832, 7919. Over Jones’s objection, the district court then applied a two-level increase pursuant to § 2T1.1(b)(2) based upon a finding that the offenses involved sophisticated means. J.A. 7832–33. The district court also applied a two- level increase pursuant to § 2T1.1(b)(1) over Jones’s objection, having found that Jones failed to report and pay taxes withheld from Lifeline employees and instead “ke[pt] that 21 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 22 of 31 money for himself.” J.A. 7833–34. Additionally, the district court applied a two-level increase pursuant to § 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice and a two-level decrease pursuant to § 4C1.1(a) because Jones was a zero-point offender who satisfied the criteria for that provision. J.A. 7834–35. The resultant total offense level was 26. J.A. 7835. Because Jones’s criminal history category was I, his Sentencing Guidelines range was determined to be 63 to 78 months of imprisonment. Id. In consideration of the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, the district court ultimately imposed a prison sentence of 78 months, comprised of concurrent 36-month sentences for Counts One and Three through Eight and a consecutive 42-month sentence for Count Two. J.A. 7854. Jones argues that the district court erred in imposing the two-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. § 2T1.1(b)(1). Section 2T1.1(b)(1) provides a two-level increase in a defendant’s offense level “[i]f the defendant failed to report or to correctly identify the source of income exceeding $10,000 in any year from criminal activity.” U.S.S.G. § 2T1.1(b)(1). The Application Notes define “[c]riminal activity” as “any conduct constituting a criminal offense under federal, state, local, or foreign law.” U.S.S.G. § 2T1.1 cmt. 4. The Background of § 2T1.1 states that “[f]ailure to report criminally derived income is included as a factor for deterrence purposes.” Here, the district court applied the § 2T1.1(b)(1) enhancement based on its determination that “[i]t was plainly criminal activity for the defendant to take—to withhold the moneys from his employees’ salaries and never pay that to the government[,]” and that Jones kept the funds he withheld for himself. J.A. 7834. The district court’s factual findings 22 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 23 of 31 are supported by a preponderance of the evidence adduced at trial. During all four quarters of 2008 and 2009, Jones withheld more than $10,000 from wages earned by employees of Lifeline as employment taxes but never paid these amounts to the government. It was not clear error for the district court to conclude that Jones kept more than $10,000 of these funds for himself. The funds Jones withheld totaled $186,519. J.A. 7913. Furthermore, the district court did not err in concluding that Jones engaged in “criminal activity” under § 2T1.1(b)(1) when he withheld funds from wages of Lifeline’s employees and retained those funds for himself instead of holding them in trust for the government and paying them over. This precise conduct constitutes a felony under the Internal Revenue Code and is punishable by imprisonment and fine: Any person required under this title to collect, account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect or truthfully account for and pay over such tax shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. 26 U.S.C. § 7202.5 As the president and owner of Lifeline, Jones was a “person” required to collect employment taxes from the wages of Lifeline employees, hold them in trust for 5 We recognize that Jones was neither charged nor convicted of any 26 U.S.C. § 7202 violation, but “criminal activity” for purposes of U.S.S.G. § 2T1.1(b)(1) is not restricted to crimes of which the defendant has been convicted. See U.S.S.G § 1B1.3(a) (providing, as a general matter, that “specific offense characteristics . . . in Chapter Two . . . shall be determined” based, in part, on “all acts and omissions” by the defendant “that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense;” “all harm that resulted from” or “was the object of” those “acts and omissions;” and “any other information specified in the applicable guideline.”); United States v. McKinney, 686 (Continued) 23 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 24 of 31 the United States, and pay them over to the government. See 26 U.S.C. § 7343 (defining “person” to include “an officer . . . of a corporation . . . , who as such officer . . . is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs”); 26 U.S.C. § 3402 (requiring employers who pay wages to “deduct and withhold” taxes from those wages); 26 U.S.C. § 7501 (requiring that withheld taxes to be held “in trust for the United States”). Jones’s willful retention of the taxes he withheld and failure to pay them over to the government constituted a criminal violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7202 and therefore “criminal activity” under U.S.S.G. § 2T1.1(b)(1). The money Jones criminally withheld from employees of Lifeline and retained was “income” that he “failed to report” to the IRS. U.S.S.G. § 2T1.1(b)(1). We conclude, therefore, that the district court did not err in applying the two-level enhancement in § 2T1.1(b)(1). The district court found support for its application of § 2T1.1(b)(1) in United States v. Heard, 709 F.3d 413 (5th Cir. 2013). In Heard, the defendant was convicted of a conspiracy to defraud the United States and two counts of tax evasion. 709 F.3d at 418. The Fifth Circuit affirmed application of § 2T1.1(b)(1) based on the defendant having “stole[n] from the IRS by withholding in excess of $10,000 in employment taxes . . . and F.3d 432, 434–37 (7th Cir. 2012) (upholding enhancement for defendant’s failure to report income from uncharged mortgage fraud); United States v. Barakat, 130 F.3d 1448, 1453 (11th Cir. 1997) (“Although the jury found that the government had not proven the mail fraud conspiracy count beyond a reasonable doubt, the district court did not clearly err in finding that a preponderance of the evidence proved Barakat had received the unreported income from criminal activity.”).When Sentencing Guidelines provisions are restricted to offenses of conviction, they use exactly that term: “offense of conviction.” 24 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 25 of 31 not paying the money to the IRS.” Heard, 709 F.3d at 423. The § 2T1.1(b)(1) enhancement in the instant case is founded upon precisely the same conduct. Jones offers several arguments in an effort to distinguish Heard. He argues that “the criminal activity underlying Mr. Heard’s § 2T1.1(b)(1) enhancement was not tax evasion but conspiracy to defraud the United States,” i.e., “a separate offense from that on which the defendant faced sentencing under § 2T1.1.” Appellant Br. 24. In the instant case, Jones argues, his retention of employment taxes—the conduct on which his § 2T1.1(b)(1) enhancement is based—is part of the same tax evasion upon which his base offense level was determined pursuant to §§ 2T1.1(a)(1) and 2T4.1. Id. at 25. Because the stolen employment taxes treated as “income” under § 2T1.1(b)(1) were also counted as part of the total tax loss used to determine his base offense level, Jones argues that applying the two-level enhancement in § 2T1.1(b)(1) “improperly double counts the value of the unpaid employee withholding[.]” Id. at 27. We are not persuaded by any of these arguments. First, the crimes for which Jones was charged and convicted are not the same crime the district court identified as grounds for applying § 2T1.1(b)(1). Jones was convicted of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct the IRS, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7212(a); tax evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7291; and six counts of filing false tax returns, in violation of 16 U.S.C. §7206(1). Although the district court did not specifically cite any statute when it applied § 2T1.1(b)(1), the crime described by the court is clearly reflected in 26 U.S.C. § 7202—that is, the defendant’s failure to pay over employment taxes he was required by statute to collect and account for as president and owner of Lifeline. 25 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 26 of 31 Second, as Jones acknowledges, double counting is not generally proscribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. See United States v. Hampton, 628 F.3d 654, 664 (4th Cir. 2010) (“[T]here is a presumption that double counting is proper where not expressly prohibited by the [G]uidelines.”). And there is nothing in the text of § 2T1.1(b)(1) or the broader structure of § 2T1.1 to suggest that the unreported and criminally sourced income that supports a § 2T1.1(b)(1) enhancement cannot include tax losses. What matters for purposes of applying § 2T1.1(b)(1) is that the money at issue is “income,” that it exceeded $10,000 in any year, that it was derived from “criminal activity,” and that the defendant “failed to report” it or “correctly identify” its source. The two-level enhancement imposed when these conditions are met is intended to deter drawing substantial “income” “from criminal activity.” In this way, the § 2T1.1(b)(1) enhancement serves a purpose separate from that served by the tax loss assessed in §§ 2T1.1(a)(1) and 2T4.1. Those sections primarily assess culpability based on loss to the government and, secondarily, gain to the defendant, irrespective of whether the gain was criminally derived. 6 We are not persuaded that it is improper to double count amounts of money that a defendant both denied the government as tax losses and, in the same instance, criminally procured as income for himself. See Heard, 709 F.3d at 424 (rejecting defendant’s double-counting argument). 6 See U.S.S.G. §§ 2T1.1, Background (“This guideline relies most heavily on the amount of loss that was the object of the offense. Tax offenses, in and of themselves, are serious offenses; however, a greater tax loss is obviously more harmful to the Treasury and more serious than a smaller one with otherwise similar characteristics. Furthermore, as the potential benefit from the offense increases, the sanction necessary to deter also increases.”). 26 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 27 of 31 Jones is mistaken in his argument that, under our reading of § 2T1.1(b)(1), “any case with a tax loss of more than $10,000 that could be considered ‘income’ would merit an enhancement.” Appellant Br. 27. Only unreported “income exceeding $10,000 in any year from criminal activity” merits the two-level increase. U.S.S.G. § 2T1.1(b)(1) (emphasis added). Under our reading of § 2T1.1(b)(1), a defendant who only evades payment of taxes by retaining income from lawful activity would not receive this enhancement. Here, in contrast, the § 2T1.1(b)(1) enhancement was predicated upon income Jones obtained criminally by taking it from Lifeline employees’ wages and keeping it for himself rather than causing Lifeline to hold it in trust and pay it over to the federal government. We agree with the district court: “This is not a case where it’s a simple failure of Mr. Jones to pay his own taxes. That would not implicate 2T1.1(b)(1) . . . . This is his failure to pay other people’s taxes and keep that money for himself, and that implicates 2T1.1(b)(1).” J.A. 7834 (citing United States v. Kearney, No. CR 19-2848 JB, 2024 WL 1112184 (D.N.M. Mar. 14, 2024)). The “criminal activity” through which Jones stole employment taxes is a characteristic of his offense conduct that makes it more culpable than simple evasion of taxes due on lawfully obtained income, and it is appropriate for the two-level increase provided in § 2T1.1(b)(1). In Heard, the Fifth Circuit rejected the defendant’s argument that the employment taxes he stole from the IRS was “legitimate income” he earned from his security business. 709 F.3d at 423–24. The stolen tax money was “derived” from a criminal conspiracy through which “Heard’s companies failed to pay to the IRS millions of dollars in employment taxes.” Id. at 424. “[T]he illegality of the funds [was] demonstrated by 27 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 28 of 31 Heard’s other tax convictions, which concern interference with the IRS’s collection of these employment taxes.” Id. Similarly here, the “income” at issue was employment taxes Jones derived from the crime of withholding it from Lifeline employees’ wages and keeping it for himself instead of holding it in trust for the federal government and paying it over. From there, like Heard, Jones interfered with the IRS’s collection of the unpaid taxes and criminally continued to evade payment. The portion of the total tax loss in this case attributable to Jones’s criminal failure to pay over employment taxes justified application of § 2T1.1(b)(1), as long as it “exceed[ed] $10,000 in any year[,]” which it did. Jones argues, in the alternative, that the rule of lenity should apply and forbid imposing § 2T1.1(b)(1) enhancement in this case. The rule of lenity “favor[s] a more lenient interpretation of a criminal statute ‘when, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an ambiguous statute.’” Kasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., 563 U.S. 1, 16, 131 S. Ct. 1325, 1336, 179 L. Ed. 2d 379 (2011) (quoting United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 17, 115 S. Ct. 382, 130 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1994)) (emphasis added). This rule “applies to the interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines in the same manner as it applies to the interpretation of criminal statutes.” United States v. Blackburn, 940 F.2d 107, 109 (4th Cir. 1991). But we perceive no ambiguity in § 2T1.1(b)(1). It plainly provides for a two-level enhancement in tax evasion cases where the defendant has “failed to report or to correctly identify the source of income exceeding $10,000 in any year from criminal activity,” as Jones failed to do in this case. Thus, in this case, § 2T1.1(b)(1) applies, and the rule of lenity does not. 28 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 29 of 31 IV. The parties agree that a discrepancy between Jones’s orally pronounced sentence of supervised release and his written judgment constitutes a sentencing error under United States v. Rogers, 961 F.3d 291 (4th Cir. 2020), requiring a remand of the case for resentencing. Rule 43(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires a criminal defendant to be present at sentencing. “Because a defendant has a right to be present when he is sentenced, a district court must orally pronounce all non-mandatory conditions of supervised release at the sentencing hearing.” United States v. Singletary, 984 F.3d at 344 (4th Cir. 2021) (citing Rogers, 961 F.3d at 296–99). This requirement “is not a meaningless formality[.]” Id. at 346 (quoting Rogers, 961 F.3d at 300). It is “a critical part of the defendant’s right to be present at sentencing[,]” id. (quoting Rogers, 961 F.3d at 300) (citation modified), because the defendant can only have an opportunity to object to a discretionary condition of supervised release if she or he is present when the condition is imposed, id. (citing Rogers, 961 F.3d at 298). A district court errs when it fails to pronounce orally at sentencing all discretionary supervised release conditions subsequently imposed in the written judgment. Rogers, 961 F.3d at 300. A Rogers error also occurs when there is “a material discrepancy between a discretionary condition as pronounced and as detailed in a written judgment . . . .” United States v. Mathis, 103 F.4th 193, 197 (4th Cir. 2024) (citation omitted). For a material discrepancy constituting a Rogers-Singletary error, there is “only one option—vacate and remand for a full resentencing.” Id. at 199–200. Here, both parties agree that there is at least one material discrepancy between the district court’s oral pronouncement of discretionary conditions of supervised release at 29 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 30 of 31 sentencing and its written judgment. During Jones’s sentencing, the district court orally pronounced as a discretionary condition of supervised release that Jones must “submit to warrantless search and seizure to ensure compliance with these conditions of your person, your home, your vehicle, your residence, your property, upon reasonable suspicion that the probation officer believes there is a violation of the terms of this supervision.” J.A. 7858– 59. This condition is listed in the written judgment, but the judgment also requires Jones to “warn any other occupants that the premises may be subject to searches pursuant to this condition.” J.A. 7865. Specifically, the district court did not orally pronounce this condition at sentencing. This omission constitutes an error under Rogers and Singletary that warrants resentencing. Indeed, the discrepancy between the supervised release conditions as orally pronounced and those listed in the written judgment in this case is similar to that examined in Mathis. In that case, the district court orally imposed a warrantless search requirement on a defendant at the sentencing hearing and then added an additional requirement in the written judgment that the defendant “warn other occupants that the premises may be subject to searches[.]” Mathis, 103 F.4th at 198. On appeal, this Court concluded that the added warning requirement was “inconsistent with the oral pronouncement and constitutes reversible error . . . .” Bound by Rogers and Singletary, this Court recognized that the Court’s “only option” was to “vacate and remand for a full resentencing.” Id. at 200. Our precedents mandate the same outcome here. We note that one material discrepancy between discretionary supervised release conditions as orally pronounced and as written in the judgment is sufficient to vacate the 30 USCA4 Appeal: 24-4288 Doc: 65 Filed: 09/19/2025 Pg: 31 of 31 sentence and remand for resentencing. See id. at 198 (“[U]nder our Rogers-Singletary jurisprudence, one rotten apple spoils the whole barrel.”); Singletary, 984 F.3d at 346 (declining to address additional claims of sentencing error after detecting a reversible sentencing error). Therefore, we need not examine the other potential grounds for Rogers error asserted by Jones in this appeal. For the reasons stated, Jones’s sentence shall be vacated and the case remanded to the district court for resentencing. V. For the reasons given above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the case is remanded for resentencing.

CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:24-CV-108-SA-RP OKTIBBEHA COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI; DELOIS FARMER; and JOHELEN WALKER DEFENDANTS ORDER AND MEMORANDUM OPINION On June 6, 2024, Carol Vaughn initiated this civil action by filing her Complaint [1] against Oktibbeha County, Mississippi; Delois Farmer; and JoHelen Walker (collectively “Defendants”). Vaughn filed her First Amended Complaint [14], which is now the operative complaint, on August 9, 2024. The First Amended Complaint [14] brings causes of action for First Amendment retaliation, race discrimination, and three state law claims. Before the Court are Oktibbeha County and Farmer’s respective Motions for Judgment on the Pleadings, or Alternatively, for Summary Judgment [49, 52]. The Motions [49, 52] have been fully briefed and are ripe for review. Having considered the parties’ filings, as well as the applicable authorities, the Court is prepared to rule. Relevant Background1 This civil action stems from Vaughn’s alleged wrongful termination as deputy clerk for the Oktibbeha County, Mississippi tax assessor’s office. The named defendants are Oktibbeha County (“the County”); the County Administrator, Delois Farmer; and the Tax Assessor/Collector, JoHelen Walker. In 2023, Walker (a Black woman) ran as a candidate for Oktibbeha County’s Tax Assessor/Collector in the local election. Prior to the election taking place, Vaughn (a White 1 As explained in more detail hereinafter, the following factual recitation is based on the factual allegations contained in the First Amended Complaint [14] and the documents attached thereto. woman) and Walker worked together in the same office under the then-incumbent Tax Assessor/Collector. However, during the election, Vaughn supported John Montgomery, Walker’s opponent. In supporting Montgomery, Vaughn attended political events “wearing Montgomery paraphernalia and, on her personal time, distributed signs for Montgomery’s campaign.” [14] at p. 3. Walker was allegedly present at events where Vaughn demonstrated her support for Montgomery. The First Amended Complaint [14] alleges that, while running for the elected position, Walker “made comments in the office which were intended to intimidate and pressure coworkers to vote for [her] rather than her political opponent, and averred that employees’ jobs would be in jeopardy if they voted for [her] opponent.” Id. Additionally, the First Amended Complaint [14] alleges that when Walker began to campaign for office she initiated a “scheme” involving public funds for the “apparent political advantage of endearing herself to prominent citizens, Starkville police officers, and others….” Id. at p. 4. Specifically, Walker “directed that certain selected city taxpayers be taxed under the lesser county tax rate, rather than the [city] tax rate[,]” which was the rate they should have been assessed. Id. Walker accomplished this by “causing these persons to be falsely listed as living in the [c]ounty, knowing that they lived in the [c]ity.” Id. The First Amended Complaint [14] alleges that Walker would often brag about the favors employees could receive from Starkville police officers in the form of ticket fixing for engaging in her same conduct. Vaughn asserts that she reported this “theft of [c]ounty funds” as soon as she learned of its occurrence. Id. at p. 3-4. On November 17, 2023, Vaughn reported Walker to the Mississippi State Auditor’s office. See [14], Ex. 2 at p. 1; [49], Ex. 4 at p. 2.2 Beginning on November 30, 2023, she 2 As noted, the County Administrator, Farmer, is also a defendant in this action. The First Amended Complaint [14] purports that Farmer was also reported to the State Auditor in addition to Walker. However, provided further details of the scheme and supporting documentation to State Auditor Investigator Scott Floyd. The same month, in November 2023, Walker was elected to the Tax Assessor/Collector position. On January 3, 2024, Walker and Farmer, the County Administrator, told Vaughn “they knew that she was the person who turned [Walker] in to the State Auditor” because Investigator Floyd had disclosed that information to them. [14] at p. 4. On the same date, “Defendants demoted [Vaughn]” from bookkeeper to deputy clerk, resulting in a reduction in salary.3 Thereafter, on January 9, 2024, after Vaughn declined to resign from her employment, “Walker informed [Vaughn]” that her employment was being terminated. At the time of her termination, Vaughn had been employed in her former position for six years. She contends she was replaced “by a far lesser- qualified black person[.]” Id. at p. 5. Vaughn claims she was terminated for engaging in political speech in support of Walker’s political opponent and for reporting Walker to the State Auditor’s office for alleged commission of unlawful activity. She also alleges that she “believes its [sic] likely that her race (white) was a contributing factor” in her termination. Id. Vaughn brings two First Amendment retaliation claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983—one is made against the County only and the other is asserted against all Defendants. She also brings claims against all Defendants for race discrimination under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and § 1983. Vaughn’s state law claims include wrongful discharge in violation of public policy against the County, violation of Mississippi’s Whistleblower Protection Vaughn’s EEOC charge, which is attached to her First Amended Complaint [14], indicates that she only reported Walker. See [14], Ex. 2 at p. 1. The actual State Auditor report, which was submitted by the County and generally referenced in the First Amended Complaint [14] as submitted by Vaughn, only reflects Walker’s name as the person against whom the report was made. See [49], Ex. 4 at p. 2. 3 The Court notes that in a different part of the First Amended Complaint [14] the date of the demotion is alleged as having occurred on January 2, 2024. Act against all Defendants, and tortious interference with employment against Farmer and Walker, individually.4 On October 9, 2024, the County filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings or, alternatively, for Summary Judgment [49]. On the same date, Farmer filed a separate Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings or, alternatively, for Summary Judgment [52]. Farmer and Walker then separately joined in the County’s Motion [49] and supporting Memorandum [51]. See [54, 58].5 The Motions [49, 52] seek dismissal of all of Vaughns claims. Vaughn opposes the same. Applicable Standard Rule 12(c) provides that “[a]fter the pleadings are closed—but early enough not to delay trial—a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.” FED. R. CIV. P. 12(c). “‘The standard for Rule 12(c) motions for judgment on the pleadings is identical to the standard for Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim.’” Murry v. City of Indianola, Mississippi, 2025 WL 978217, at *6 (N.D. Miss. Mar. 31, 2025) (quoting Waller v. Hanlon, 922 F.3d 590, 599 (5th Cir. 2019)). “To survive a Rule 12(c) motion, ‘a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Laviage v. Fite, 47 F.4th 402, 405 (5th Cir. 2022) (quoting Waller, 922 F.3d at 599). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). “The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability 4 Farmer and Walker are only sued in their individual capacities. Vaughn makes no official capacity claims against them. See [14] at pp. 2, 5. 5 More specifically, Farmer and Walker join in the County’s Motion [49] and supporting Memorandum [51] “in so much as it applies to [them], including but not limited to, the arguments regarding (1) both First Amendment claims, (2) Mississippi Whistleblower Protection Act claim, and (3) Oktibbeha County’s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for Vaughn’s termination.” [54] at p. 1; [58] at p. 1. requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” Id., 129 S. Ct. 1937 (citations omitted). “When confronted with a qualified-immunity defense at the pleadings stage, the plaintiff must plead ‘facts which, if proved, would defeat [the] claim of immunity.’” Santander v. Salazar, 133 F.4th 471, 478 (5th Cir. 2025) (quoting Waller, 922 F.3d at 599). This is the case because “‘[i]t is the plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate that qualified immunity is inappropriate’ at the motion to dismiss stage.” Id. (quoting Guerra v. Castillo, 82 F.4th 278, 285 (5th Cir. 2023)). “A court must ‘carefully scrutinize [the complaint] before subjecting public officials to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery.’” Id. (quoting Longoria Next Friend of M.L. v. San Benito Indep. Consol. Sch. Dist., 942 F.3d 258, 263–64 (5th Cir. 2019)). The Court acknowledges that “‘an assertion of qualified immunity… does not subject the complaint to a heightened pleading standard.’” Id. (quoting Arnold v. Williams, 979 F.3d 262, 267 (5th Cir. 2020)). However, “the district court must ‘do more than determine whether the plaintiff has filed a short and plain statement of his complaint, a statement that rests on more than conclusions alone.’” Id. (quoting Anderson v. Valdez, 845 F.3d 580, 590 (5th Cir. 2016)). “Under Rule 12(c), courts ‘accept all facts as pleaded and construe them in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff].’” Hickman v. City of Newton, Mississippi, 2025 WL 1699359, at *4 (S.D. Miss. June 17, 2025) (quoting Guerra, 82 F.4th at 282). As with Rule 12(b)(6) motions, the inquiry is limited to “(1) the facts set forth in the complaint, (2) documents attached to the complaint, and (3) matters of which judicial notice may be taken under Federal Rule of Evidence 201.” Walker v. Beaumont Indep. Sch. Dist., 938 F.3d 724, 735 (5th Cir. 2019). “When a defendant attaches documents to its motion that are referred to in the complaint and are central to the plaintiff’s claims, the court may also properly consider those documents.” Id. Analysis and Discussion The Defendants seek judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) or, alternatively, summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. See [49, 52]. Before turning to the merits of the claims, the Court will address two preliminary arguments Vaughn raises in her Response Memorandums [79, 81] related to the timeliness of the Motions [49, 52] and their conversion to summary judgment motions. I. Timeliness of Motions First, Vaughn argues that the Motions [49, 52] are not properly before the Court under Rule 12(c). Again, Rule 12(c) provides that “[a]fter the pleadings are closed—but early enough not to delay trial—a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.” FED. R. CIV. P. 12(c) (emphasis added). Vaughn contends that the filing of the Motions [49, 52] delays the trial in this case. She seemingly requests that the Motions [49, 52] be stricken for that reason. As to the delay, Vaughn points to the stay of discovery in this case, which was triggered when Farmer’s Motion [52] was filed as it raises a qualified immunity defense. The Court need not rehash its justification for imposing a stay on discovery but reiterates that it entered the stay on its own accord and in accordance with the Local Rules. See [102]. Vaughn raises no other argument as to how the Motions [49, 52] delayed the trial in this case. The Court notes that the pleadings were closed on August 23, 2024. The instant Motions [49, 52] were filed approximately a month and a half later on October 9, 2024, “early enough not to delay trial.” FED. R. CIV. P. 12(c). The Court finds it unnecessary to delve further into this issue. Vaughn’s conclusory assertion on this point is without merit. II. Rule 56 Conversion Second, Vaughn argues against the conversion of the Motions [49, 52] to motions for summary judgment. “Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(d) gives the courts discretion, when presented with material beyond the scope of a 12(b)(6) [or 12(c)] motion, to convert the motion into one for summary judgment.” Barbe v. Strategic Claim Consultants LLC, 2022 WL 1099803, at *2 (W.D. La. Apr. 12, 2022) (citing Isquith v. Middle S. Utilities, Inc., 847 F.2d 186, 194 n.3 (5th Cir. 1988)). “Courts accept extra-pleading materials and convert Rule 12 motions to Rule 56 motions when those materials are ‘likely to facilitate the disposition of the action’ and ‘will enable a rational determination of a summary judgment motion.’” United States ex rel. Sibley v. Delta Reg’l Med. Ctr., 2019 WL 1301967, at *2 (N.D. Miss. Mar. 21, 2019) (quoting Isquith, 847 F.2d at 194 n.3). “If the material is scanty, incomplete, or inconclusive, the court will likely refuse to convert the motion.” Lampley v. Brown, 2019 WL 4050523, at *1 (M.D. La. Aug. 9, 2019) (citing Ware v. Associated Milk Producers, Inc., 614 F.2d 413, 415 (5th Cir. 1980)). Additionally, “[t]he Fifth Circuit also counsels against conversion to a motion for summary judgment without affording the adversary ‘an opportunity to conduct discovery.’” Taylor v. Hartley, 488 F. Supp. 3d 517, 528 (S.D. Tex. 2020) (quoting Benchmark Electronics Inc. v. J.M. Huber Corp., 343 F.3d 719, 725 (5th Cir. 2003)). Vaughn again points to the stay of discovery imposed by the Court sua sponte, which she argues prevented her from taking several noticed depositions and from obtaining competent evidence necessary to establish her case. She attaches to her Responses [78, 80] a sworn Affidavit executed by her attorney, Jim Waide, wherein Mr. Waide states that “[Vaughn] cannot adequately respond to the pending Motions for Summary Judgment, as certain facts are not available to [Vaughn] in light of the stay.” [78], Ex. 1 at p. 1; [80], Ex. 1 at p. 1. For their part, the Defendants argue that there is no requirement that discovery take place before a grant of a summary judgment motion, and that Vaughn has made no request “for a continuance” under Rule 56(d). See [87] at p. 3. Ultimately, the Court declines to convert the Motions [49, 52] to motions for summary judgment because the extrinsic materials submitted by the County are inconclusive and do not facilitate in the disposition of this case. The Court’s specific reasoning for that determination will be explained hereinafter in the appropriate subsections.6 Having addressed these preliminary matters, the Court will turn to Vaughn’s claims beginning with her federal claims and then turning to her state law claims. III. Federal Claims As indicated above, Vaughn asserts two separate First Amendment retaliation claims. She also asserts race discrimination claims under the Equal Protection Clause, Title VII, and Section 1981.7 The Court will address these claims successively. A. Section 1983 Claims – Generally “Regarding Section 1983, the United States Supreme Court has held that the statute’s ‘very purpose. . . was to interpose the federal courts between the States and the people, as guardians of the people’s federal rights—to protect the people from unconstitutional action under color of state law.’” Alexander v. McAdams, 2017 WL 5642328, at *3 (N.D. Miss. Apr. 18, 2017) (quoting Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 242, 92 S. Ct. 2151, 32 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1972)) (emphasis in 6 The Court acknowledges that this case has been stayed since October 16, 2024—approximately two months after Vaughn filed her First Amended Complaint [14]. See [61]. Prior to the stay, the parties exchanged initial disclosures, and thereafter Vaughn propounded two sets of written discovery. Since the Court has declined to convert the Motions [49, 52] on other grounds, the issue of whether Vaughn had an adequate opportunity to conduct discovery is moot. 7 To be clear, the First Amendment retaliation claims and the Equal Protection claim are asserted pursuant to Section 1983. original). “Therefore, to succeed on a Section 1983 claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate: ‘(1) a violation of the United States Constitution or of federal law; and (2) that the violation was committed by someone acting under color of state law.’” Id. (quoting Hutton v. Shamrock Ridge Homeowners Ass’n, 2009 WL 4796626, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 14, 2009) (in turn citing City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 117, 108 S. Ct. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988)). Different standards apply to a Section 1983 claim against a municipality and an individual capacity claim against a government official. See Valle v. City of Houston, 613 F.3d 536, 541-42 (5th Cir. 2010) (to establish municipal liability under Section 1983, “[a] plaintiff must identify: ‘(1) an official policy (or custom), of which (2) a policymaker can be charged with actual or constructive knowledge, and (3) a constitutional violation whose ‘moving force’ is that policy or custom.”); Goodman v. Harris Cnty., 571 F.3d 388, 395 (5th Cir. 2009) (“In a personal-capacity suit, it is enough to show that the official, acting under color of state law, caused the deprivation of a federal right. In such a suit, the official may assert personal immunity defenses such as qualified immunity.”) Regardless of whether a plaintiff seeks to impose liability against a municipality or against an individual official, the plaintiff must establish a constitutional violation. See Valle, 613 F.3d at 541-42; Goodman, 571 F.3d at 395 (explaining that the first step in evaluating qualified immunity is to “determine whether plaintiff alleged a violation of a clearly established constitutional right. . .”). In other words, if the First Amended Complaint [14] does not allege a plausible constitutional violation, Vaughn’s Section 1983 claims will be subject to dismissal. Accordingly, the Court will begin its analysis with whether Vaughn has sufficiently pled the existence of a constitutional violation. 1. First Amendment Retaliation Claims “The Supreme Court has made clear that public employees do not surrender all their First Amendment rights by reason of their employment.” McAdams v. Ladner, 608 F. Supp. 3d 416, 423 (S.D. Miss. 2022) (quoting Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 417, 126 S. Ct. 1951, 164 L. Ed. 2d 689 (2006)) (internal quotation marks omitted). “The First Amendment protects a public employee’s right, in certain circumstances, to speak as a citizen on a matter of public concern.” Brown v. Bd. of Trs. Sealy Indep. Sch. Dist., 871 F. Supp. 2d 581, 597 (S.D. Tex. 2012) (citing Davis v. McKinney, 518 F.3d 304, 311 (5th Cir.2008)). “Matters of public concern are those which can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community.” Branton v. City of Dallas, 272 F.3d 730, 739 (5th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). As noted, Vaughn brings two First Amendment retaliation claims— the first related to her report to the State Auditor and the second related to her political activity in support of Montgomery. The Court will analyze the claims separately as the claims involve different forms of speech. a. Report to State Auditor8 Vaughn claims that she was terminated for reporting Walker’s allegedly illegal activity to the State Auditor. In order to state a claim for First Amendment retaliation, Vaughn “must plead 8 The Court notes that Vaughn’s First Amendment retaliation claim related to her report to the State Auditor’s office is listed as “Count I” in the First Amended Complaint [14] and appears to be made only against the County and no other defendant. See [14] at p. 5 (“Defendant Oktibbeha County, Mississippi is liable for this violation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment right to free speech.”) (emphasis added). The First Amended Complaint [14] lists a total of six counts and each count specifies which defendant the referenced claim is being brought against. See [14] at p. 5 (compare Counts II, IV and VI made against “[a]ll Defendants” or broadly against “Defendants” to Counts I and III, which respectively state that “Defendant Oktibbeha County, Mississippi is liable…” and “Defendant Oktibbeha County, Mississippi violated state law…”). Count I does not reference Walker and Farmer’s potential liability for that claim unlike Count V which charges the “Individual Defendants.” Id. As such, the Court declines to recognize this claim as raised against any defendant other than the County. that: ‘(1) [she] suffered an adverse employment action; (2) [she] spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern; (3) [her] interest in the speech outweighs the government’s interest in the efficient provision of public services; and (4) the speech precipitated the adverse employment action.’” Johnson v. Miller, 126 F.4th 1020, 1029 (5th Cir. 2025) (quoting Wilson v. Tregre, 787 F.3d 322, 325 (5th Cir. 2015)). At this stage, the County only contests the second element. See [87] at p. 14 n. 68. “With regard to the second element of the requisite analysis, the Court must engage in a two-step evaluation, first determining whether the plaintiff was speaking as a citizen rather than as an employee and next whether the speech was on a topic of public concern.” Marceaux v. Lafayette City-Par. Consol. Gov’t, 921 F. Supp. 2d 605, 634 (W.D. La. 2013) (citing Davis v. McKinney, 518 F.3d 304, 311–12 (5th Cir. 2008)); Harrison v. Lilly, 854 F. App’x 554, 556 (5th Cir. 2021). The Court will address each prong in turn. i. Whether Vaughn spoke as a citizen The County first argues that Vaughn spoke as an employee pursuant to her official duties when she made the report to the State Auditor and, therefore, her report does not constitute protected speech under the First Amendment. “When public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.” Harrison, 854 F. App’x at 556 (quoting Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 421, 126 S. Ct. 1951) (internal quotation marks omitted). “‘Official duties’ are tasks that employees are required to perform as part of their job responsibilities.” Id. (citing Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 421-22, 126 S. Ct. 1951). On this point, Vaughn disputes that her job responsibilities as a bookkeeper required her to report alleged illegal activity to the State Auditor. See [81] at p. 13 (arguing that “[r]eporting a crime to the State Auditor is not a matter within the scope of a bookkeeper’s duties.”). Before addressing the parties’ specific arguments, the Court is compelled to point out that the County’s arguments surround Vaughn’s alleged duties as a deputy clerk and not as a bookkeeper. Notably, the First Amended Complaint [14] alleges that, at the time Vaughn made the report to the State Auditor in November 2023, she held the position of bookkeeper, and it was not until January 2024 that Vaughn was demoted “from the position of Bookkeeper to Deputy Clerk… .” [14] at p. 4-5. Though neither party points to any distinction between the two job titles, it appears from the facts alleged in the First Amended Complaint [14] that there could be a difference between them—particularly in that one position is specifically alleged as a demotion in comparison to the other. Nonetheless, the parties appear to use the two job titles interchangeably in the fact sections of their respective filings. See [51] at p. 3; [81] at p. 3. And while Vaughn denies that her report to the State Auditor was within the scope of her bookkeeper duties, she does not, in responding to the County’s arguments, argue that the bookkeeper position is distinct from that of deputy clerk nor that the positions’ respective duties vastly differ without overlap. As such, the Court need not further address this nonissue and will consider the parties’ arguments without distinguishing between the two positions. Returning to the question at hand, the Fifth Circuit has described the task of determining whether an employee spoke pursuant to her official duties as a “practical” inquiry and a “fact- intensive analysis.” See Foerster v. Bleess, 2022 WL 38996, at *2 (5th Cir. Jan. 4, 2022); see also Gibson v. Kilpatrick, 773 F.3d 661, 667 (5th Cir. 2014). In analyzing this issue, the Fifth Circuit considers the following non-dispositive factors: (1) “the relationship between the speech and the employee’s job,” (2) “whether the speech was made up the chain of command,” and (3) “whether the speech resulted from special knowledge acquired as an employee.” Id. (citing Gibson, 773 F.3d at 667-68, 670).9 Ultimately, the critical question is “whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee’s duties, not whether it merely concerns those duties.” Lane v. Franks, 573 U.S. 228, 240, 134 S. Ct. 2369, 189 L. Ed. 2d 312 (2014). The County argues that all of the above factors weigh in favor of finding that Vaughn was speaking as a public employee rather than a citizen when she reported alleged illegal activity to the State Auditor. In doing so, the County relies on several documents attached to its Motion [49], including Vaughn’s actual report to the State Auditor. As to the first factor, the County makes much of the fact that Vaughn explains in the report that she realized the alleged tax scheme was occurring while she was reviewing other clerks’ tax district entries to ensure their accuracy. The County argues that Vaughn concedes, through her report, that part of her official duties was to make sure the correct tax district was “being attached” to taxpayers. [51] at p. 28. The Court need not determine whether the report sufficiently establishes Vaughn’s official duties to reject this argument as it clearly misses the mark. Even assuming for the sake of argument that ensuring the accuracy of tax districts was part of Vaughn’s job, according to the First Amended Complaint [14], the subject of Vaughn’s report to the State Auditor was not the inaccuracy of certain tax district entries—it was Walker’s alleged tax rigging scheme. See [14] at p. 4. The County does not argue that the report itself was made as part of Vaughn’s process of ensuring the accuracy of tax district entries. It also does not argue that Vaughn’s job duties required 9 Though the above factors appear more broadly stated, the Fifth Circuit has in the past considered more specific “factors such as job descriptions, whether the employee communicated with coworkers or with supervisors, whether the speech resulted from special knowledge gained as an employee, and whether the speech was directed internally or externally.” Johnson v. Halstead, 916 F.3d 410, 422 (5th Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). her to report the alleged tax rigging scheme to the State Auditor. Beyond mere conjecture, the County does not link the speech at issue with “the scope” of any alleged official duty. Lane, 573 U.S. at 240, 134 S. Ct. 2369 (emphasis added). The County’s next argument regarding the first factor fails for the same reason. The County points to Mississippi statutory law providing that tax collectors are required to make monthly written reports to “the Auditor of Public Accounts… of all taxes collected by him during the preceding month for the state…[,]” but fails to explain the relevance of those monthly reports to the speech at issue here. MISS. CODE ANN. § 27-29-11. Not only has the County not established that the statutorily required reports involve or include reports to the State Auditor for illegal activity, but even if it had, it has not shown that the task of submitting the monthly reports was delegated specifically to Vaughn. In short, the Court finds conclusory and unsupported the County’s overarching argument that the “report to the state auditor is part of [Vaughn’s] official duties as a deputy in the Oktibbeha County tax office.” [51] at p. 29. The County has presented no argument, much less conclusive proof, connecting Vaughn’s report to any of her alleged duties as a bookkeeper/deputy clerk. Absent this, the County has not demonstrated a “relationship” between the report and Vaughn’s job. Foerster, 2022 WL 38996 at *2. According to the First Amended Complaint [14], Vaughn’s job duties did not include reporting illegal activity to the State Auditor. See [14] at p. 5. Accepting this allegation as true, the first factor of this inquiry weighs in favor of Vaughn speaking as a citizen when she made her report to the State Auditor. The second factor looks to “whether the speech was made up the chain of command[.]” Foerster, 2022 WL 38996 at *2. Regarding this factor, the parties do not dispute that the State Auditor’s office, to which Vaughn made the report, “is an external entity” and therefore outside of the relevant chain of command. [51] at p. 30. Despite this, the County argues that Vaughn reported Walker’s alleged misconduct internally to the office manager of the Oktibbeha County tax office before her report to the State Auditor, and thus was speaking as an employee.10 Crucially, the County provides no argument nor proof as to how the chain of command is structured within the Oktibbeha County tax office and on what level of the hierarchy, if at all, the office manager sits. In support of this proposition, the County again references Vaughn’s report to the state auditor. The County highlights a narrative contained in the report of the office manager explaining to Walker that Vaughn was reviewing all clerks’ tax district entries in response to Walker’s comment that she was being picked on. It argues that “Vaughn clearly communicated this issue internally prior to reporting the problem externally to the state auditor’s office.” Id. at p. 29-30. Assuming arguendo that the office manager is within the chain of command, the Court disagrees that the report conclusively demonstrates that Vaughn reported Walker’s alleged misconduct to the office manager. While Vaughn’s statement in the report appears to indicate that the office manager was aware that Vaughn was reviewing tax district entries, the Court declines to speculate that Vaughn must have reported Walker’s alleged tax rigging scheme (the subject her report to the 10 The County acknowledges that the Fifth Circuit has in the past held “that when speech is made ‘to persons outside the workplace in addition to raising them up the chain of command at his workplace, then those external communications are ordinarily not made as an employee, but as a citizen.’” Foerster, 2022 WL 38996 at *2 (quoting Davis v. McKinney, 518 F.3d 304, 313 (5th Cir. 2008)). Based on this precedent, whether Vaughn internally reported Walker appears irrelevant at first glance. However, the County reiterates its argument that Vaughn’s report to the State Auditor was made as part of her official job duties and is therefore unprotected when addressing the second factor. In Foerster, the Fifth Circuit further explained “that employee speech, made within or outside the chain of command and which would otherwise be unprotected from being the basis for discipline, is not transformed into protected speech simply by continuing to express those same concerns to certain external parties.” Id. (citing Corn v. Mississippi. Dep’t of Pub. Safety, 954 F.3d 268, 278 (5th Cir. 2020); Anderson v. Valdez, 913 F.3d 472, 478 (5th Cir. 2019)). It is unclear whether the County is contending that Vaughn’s speech is unprotected irrespective of her report being directed externally because she acted pursuant to her duties and first made the report up the chain of command. To the extent it is making such argument, the Court has already rejected the notion that Vaughn’s report to the State Auditor was made pursuant to her job duties in relation to the first factor. Nonetheless, the Court will address the County’s remaining arguments out of an abundance of caution. State Auditor) to the office manager before reporting the same to the State Auditor. The County provides no further argument surrounding any internal report by Vaughn. The First Amended Complaint [14] alleges, and the parties do not dispute, that Vaughn’s speech in the form of her report to the State Auditor, was directed externally. Factor two weighs in favor of Vaughn speaking as a citizen in making her report. See Foerster, 2022 WL 38996 at *2.11 Finally, the Court turns to “whether the speech resulted from special knowledge acquired as an employee.” Foerster, 2022 WL 38996 at *2. The County argues that Vaughn would not have been aware of the incorrect tax district entries without her special knowledge of the tax codes and system employed in the Oktibbeha County tax office. In response, Vaughn quotes Charles v. Grief, 522 F.3d 508 (5th Cir. 2008), without elaborating as to the applicability of that case to this inquiry. Nonetheless, even accepting the County’s argument, “the mere fact that a citizen’s speech concerns information acquired by virtue of his public employment does not transform that speech into employee—rather than citizen—speech.” Lane, 573 U.S. at 240, 134 S. Ct. 2369. Applying a practical inquiry, the Court finds that the First Amended Complaint [14] alleges sufficient facts to support that Vaughn was speaking as a citizen when she made her report to the State Auditor. See Foerster, 2022 WL 38996 at *2 (“None of [the] factors are dispositive.”). As explained above, the extrinsic material relied upon by the County does not support a finding otherwise; thus, the County fails to carry its burden as to this subset of Vaughn’s claim. 11 The County raises one additional argument that is easily rejected. It argues that Vaughn’s report is unprotected speech because the State Auditor’s office was the most appropriate entity to report Walker’s alleged misconduct. The Fifth Circuit has suggested that a report to an external agency “may still be unprotected if that agency is ‘the most appropriate entity to which to report the misconduct.’” Id. at *3 (quoting Gibson, 773 F.3d at 670). That is, however, applicable in circumstances where the employee is reporting misconduct by a supervisor. See Gibson, 773 F.3d at 670. It is undisputed that Walker was not Vaughn’s supervisor at the time the report to the State Auditor was made. As such, the Court rejects this argument. ii. Public Concern The second prong of this element concerns whether Vaughn’s speech involved a matter of public concern. “The determination of whether a public employee’s speech addresses a matter of public concern is not a factual issue; it is a question of law to be decided by the court.” Marceaux, 921 F. Supp. 2d at 634 (citing Coughlin v. Lee, 946 F.2d 1152, 1156 (5th Cir. 1991)). “Although the distinction between matters of public concern and matters of private concern is not always clear, matters of public concern are generally considered to be ‘any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community.’” Id. (quoting Thompson v. City of Starkville, Miss., 901 F.2d 456, 461 (5th Cir. 1990)). “To determine whether a statement addresses a matter of public concern, the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record must be considered.” Id. (citing Thompson, 901 F.2d at 461). “The Fifth Circuit ‘has held that speech reporting official misconduct, wrongdoing, or malfeasance on the part of public officials involves matters of public concern.’” Brown, 871 F. Supp. 2d at 597 (quoting Denton v. Morgan, 136 F.3d 1038, 1043 (5th Cir. 1998)). The parties do not dispute that the content of Vaughn’s report to the State Auditor involved a matter of public concern as it was a report of official misconduct. They likewise do not dispute that this particular form of speech weighs in favor of finding that Vaughn spoke on a matter of public concern. The County’s arguments appear to be centered on the context surrounding Vaughn’s report. Specifically, the County argues that the report was “motivated exclusively” or “primarily” by Vaughn’s personal concerns in her future employment because her preferred candidate lost and therefore the speech is unprotected. [51] at pp. 35, 37. In support of its position, the County relies in part on the analysis of the District Court for the Southern District of Texas in Ostrewich v. City of Palacios, Texas, 2024 WL 1258672, at *3 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 25, 2024), wherein the court, relying on Dodds v. Childers, 933 F.2d 271 (5th Cir. 1991), noted that it “‘may therefore be required to assess the primary motivation of the speaker in evaluating whether her speech addresses a matter of public concern.’” Id. Crucially, Dodds was a case involving “mixed speech.” See Dodds, 933 F.2d at 273-274. To be clear, “mixed speech” is an employee’s speech which contains “elements of both personal and public concern.” Salge v. Edna Indep. Sch. Dist., 411 F.3d 178, 186 (5th Cir. 2005). In Dodds, a community college employee alleged that one of her colleagues received special treatment because of a familial relationship with the president of the college’s board of trustees. 933 F.2d at 272. There, the Fifth Circuit recognized that the employee’s speech implicated both private and public interests and considered the employee’s motivation in analyzing the content of her speech. Id. In addition to Dodds, the Fifth Circuit has considered the speaker’s motivation (i.e. personal interest) in evaluating the content of the speech at issue in other cases. See Markos v. City of Atlanta, Tex., 364 F.3d 567, 571 (5th Cir. 2004) (addressing issues of personal interest within the “content” portion of its analysis in a case involving mixed speech); see also Dorsett v. Bd. of Trs. for State Colleges & Universities, 940 F.2d 121, 124-25 (5th Cir. 1991) (evaluating plaintiff’s “primary motivation” through examining the content of his speech, in addition to other evidence, and then analyzing the speech’s form and context separately). Here, the County does not identify any portion of Vaughn’s report to the State Auditor that could be construed as touching on a matter of private concern so as to render this case a “mixed speech” case where the court “may… be required to assess the primary motivation of the speaker[.]” Dodds, 933 F.2d at 273. 12 Additionally, it does not dispute that the content of Vaughn’s speech involves a matter of public concern. Thus, unlike Dodds, Markos, and Dorsett, Vaughn’s 12 Additionally, the County relies heavily on this Court’s decision in Dunn v. Tunica Cnty., 2021 WL 40266 (N.D. Miss. Jan. 5, 2021). Dunn was also a “mixed speech” case. See id. at *6. alleged motivations in making the report are irrelevant at this juncture. The County’s argument that Vaughn made the report based on personal ulterior motives has no bearing because there is simply no dispute as to the public nature of the content of Vaughn’s speech. Aside from focusing on Vaughn’s alleged motivation, the County raises no further argument regarding the context of Vaughn’s speech. See Markos, 364 F.3d at 572 (rejecting the proposition that “motivation is the new litmus test for the matter of public concern analysis, displacing the [content, context, and form] factors”). The Court will nonetheless still consider the context of Vaughn’s speech. “‘The context inquiry analyzes the underlying philosophical, political, and social circumstances surrounding an employee’s speech.’” Muslow v. Bd. of Supervisors of Louisiana State Univ., 2020 WL 4471647, at *22 (E.D. La. Aug. 4, 2020) (quoting Davis v. Allen Par. Serv. Dist., 210 F. App’x 404, 410 (5th Cir. 2006)). “Speech is made in the context of a matter of public concern when it occurs ‘against a backdrop of widespread debate in the community’ rather than when it is ‘made solely in furtherance of a personal employer-employee dispute.’” Id. (quoting Gibson v. Kilpatrick, 838 F.3d 476, 486-87 (5th Cir. 2016)). The First Amended Complaint [14] alleges that Walker was elected during the same month that Vaughn made her report to the State Auditor, but it does not allege that Walker’s involvement in the alleged tax rigging scheme was the subject of widespread debate within the community at that time. On the other hand, there are also no facts in the First Amended Complaint [14] that indicate that an employer-employee dispute existed at the time Vaughn submitted the report in November 2023. It was not until Walker took office in January 2024 that a dispute arose in relation to Vaughn’s employment. See [14] at p. 3. The Court finds that, at this stage of the proceedings, this factor is neutral given the limited facts available. “In considering the content, form, and context of a statement to determine whether it involves matters of public concern, ‘no factor is dispositive.’” Muslow, 2020 WL 4471647 at *21 (quoting Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443, 454, 131 S. Ct. 1207, 179 L. Ed. 2d 172 (2011)). The content and form factors weigh in favor of finding that Vaughn’s speech involved a matter of public concern and the context factor is neutral. Considering all factors, the Court finds that “in this case the balance tips in favor of a finding of public concern.” Markos, 364 F.3d at 574. Ultimately, the Court finds that Vaughn has sufficiently pled a First Amendment retaliation claim against the County related to her report to the State Auditor. b. Political Patronage Vaughn also brings a First Amendment retaliation claim against all Defendants alleging that she was terminated for supporting Montgomery—Walker’s political opponent. “A First Amendment political retaliation claim requires proof that a plaintiff (a) suffered an adverse employment action (b) because of (c) his ‘speech or activity related to a matter of public concern.’” Maldonado v. Rodriguez, 932 F.3d 388, 391 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting Aucoin v. Haney, 306 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir. 2002)). In this case, the parties do not dispute that the First Amended Complaint [14] alleges that Vaughn was terminated because she engaged in political activity in support of Walker’s opponent. The Fifth Circuit has held that “campaigning for a political candidate relates to a matter of public concern.” Maldonado, 932 F.3d at 391 (internal quotations and citations omitted).13 As such, the Court finds that Vaughn has sufficiently pled a prima facie claim of First 13 Vaughn brings this claim against all Defendants, but there exists a caveat with respect to Farmer’s individual liability. “In a First Amendment retaliation claim against an individual defendant, the plaintiff must plead that the individual defendant’s ‘animus against [her] exercise of First Amendment rights is a link in the causal chain that led to [her] firing.’” Sullivan v. City of Dallas, Texas, 2022 WL 3648625, at *7 (N.D. Tex. July 29, 2022) (quoting Jones v. Hoseman, 812 F. App’x 235, 239 (5th Cir. 2020) (in turn quoting Sims v. City of Madisonville, 894 F.3d 632, 639 (5th Cir. 2018)). As Farmer points out, the First Amended Complaint [14] is void of any allegation that Farmer harbored any animus against Vaughn for supporting Walker’s political opponent or that she was even aware of Vaughn’s activity. As such, this claim Amendment political retaliation against the County and Walker. See Garza v. Escobar, 972 F.3d 721, 728 (5th Cir. 2020) (recognizing the elements of a prima facie First Amendment political retaliation claim as set forth in Maldonado). The parties dispute, however, whether Vaughn was subject to political patronage dismissal—an “exception to the First Amendment’s protection.” Id. at 729. Often referred to as the Elrod-Branti exception, “[t]he First Amendment generally prohibits adverse employment actions against government employees based on political affiliation, but, where an employee’s private political beliefs would interfere with the discharge of her public duties, her First Amendment rights may be required to yield to the [government’s] vital interest in maintaining governmental effectiveness and efficiency[.]” Haddock v. Tarrant Cnty., Texas, 852 F. App’x 826, 829 (5th Cir. 2021) (citing Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S. Ct. 2673, 49 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1976); Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 517, 100 S. Ct. 1287, 63 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1980)). The Defendants bear the burden of “‘establish[ing] that the government’s interest in promoting the efficiency of the services provided by its employees outweighs [Vaughn’s] interest in engaging in the protected activity.’” Garza, 972 F.3d at 729 (quoting Vojvodich v. Lopez, 48 F.3d 879, 885 (5th Cir. 1995)). “‘This analysis in reality is a sliding scale or spectrum upon which ‘public concern’ is weighed against disruption.’” Id. (quoting Vojvodich, 48 F.3d at 885); see also Maldonado, 932 F.3d at 392 (“this circuit, interpreting the [Supreme] Court’s decisions, places cases involving only political association, only speech, or a combination of the two on a spectrum.”). “Where nonpolicymaking, nonconfidential employees are discharged solely because of their private political views, little, if any weighing of an employee’s First Amendment rights against an fails as to Farmer individually. Additionally, Farmer is the only individual defendant who raises a qualified immunity defense. The Court will address that defense later in this opinion. employer’s right to loyal and efficient service is necessary, and the employee’s rights will usually prevail. On the opposite end of the spectrum, however, are cases where employees’ exercise of First Amendment privileges clearly over-balanced their usefulness.” Maldonado, 932 F.3d at 392 (internal quotations and citations omitted). “[W]here a public employee… occupies a confidential or policymaking role, the employer’s interests more easily outweigh the employee’s First Amendment rights.” Id. “The ultimate issue thus requires balancing of the [employee’s] First Amendment right to participate in political activity against the legitimate needs of the employer… to provide efficient public service.” Id. “We make that determination based on the specific facts of each case.” Garza, 972 F.3d at 729 (citing Maldonado, 932 F.3d at 392) (“The balancing test is case-specific.”). Here, the parties do not dispute that Vaughn is a confidential employee for purposes of this analysis. Therefore, the Court need not address that aspect of this inquiry. “Concluding an employee occupies a confidential or policymaking role, however, does not completely answer whether the employee can properly be subject to patronage dismissal.” Garza, 972 F.3d at 729. “While the labels ‘policymaker’ and confidential’ are helpful, ‘the ultimate question is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for effective performance of the public office involved.” Id. (quoting Branti, 445 U.S. at 518, 100 S. Ct. 1287). In Garza, the Fifth Circuit, relying on its decision in Vojvodich, explained that in order to “answer that question, some of [its] cases also ask whether the employee’s activities in some way adversely affected the government’s ability to provide services.” Id. (internal quotations and citations omitted). The Defendants present arguments surrounding the Pickering-Connick balancing test to support their argument that Vaughn was subject to patronage dismissal.14 However, the Court notes that the Defendants do not provide extensive argument relative to whether Vaughn’s political activity in “some way adversely affected the government’s ability to provide services” as considered by the Fifth Circuit in Garza. Id. The only potential disruption to the tax office that the Defendants allege is based on complaints that Vaughn campaigned for Walker’s opponent while in the workplace. Defendants support this contention by referencing a single email thread between Farmer and the former Tax Assessor/Collector Allen Morgan. In the Court’s view, this evidence does not conclusively establish that Vaughn disrupted the tax office and therefore declines to consider it. See Brown, 2019 WL 4050523 at *1 (“If the material is scanty, incomplete, or inconclusive, the court will likely refuse to convert the motion [to a summary judgment motion].”).15 The Court is cognizant that courts within the Fifth Circuit do “not require employers to wait until their office is disrupted before taking action.” Garza, 972 F.3d at 732. Nonetheless, “[e]very one of [the Pickering-Connick] factors depends on the consequences of the employee’s… First Amendment activity which gives rise to the balancing of interests.” De La Garza v. Brumby, 2013 WL 754260, at *4 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 27, 2013); see also Vojvodich, 48 F.3d at 885-86. The Defendants must rely on some factual allegations that demonstrate how Vaughn’s political activity 14 In balancing the employee’s and the government’s interest in the context of First Amendment claims, the Fifth Circuit employs the Pickering-Connick balancing test and considers “(1) the degree to which the employee’s activity involved a matter of public concern; (2) the time, place, and manner of the employee’s activity; (3) whether close working relationships are essential to fulfilling the employer’s public responsibilities and the potential effect of the employee’s activity on those relationships; (4) whether the employee’s activity may be characterized as hostile, abusive, or insubordinate; (5) whether the activity impairs discipline by superiors or harmony among coworkers.” Jordan v. Ector Cnty., 516 F.3d 290, 299 (5th Cir. 2008). 15 Specifically, the particular email relied upon by the Defendants states that alleged complaints were made to Farmer regarding a clerk campaigning in the tax office, but Farmer’s email does not identify Vaughn by name as being the clerk complained of. The email provides no context as to the alleged activity complained of nor does it identify which candidate was being campaigned for. “adversely affected the government’s ability to provide services.” Garza, 972 F.3d at 729. They fail to sufficiently do so. The Defendants’ arguments relative to the Pickering-Connick factors do not warrant a finding in their favor despite Vaughn’s status as a confidential employee. Again, as to the first factor, Vaughn’s campaigning for a political candidate involved a matter of public concern. See Maldonado, 932 F.3d at 391. Regarding the time, place, and manner of Vaughn’s activity (factor two), the Defendants appear to merge their argument with factor four. They argue that even if Vaughn’s campaigning occurred outside of the office “it would be considered by most employers insubordinate or hostile behavior toward the employer.” [51] at p. 45. But they provide no facts from this case to support that contention. The Defendants’ arguments concerning factor three overlap, in part, with Vaughn’s status as a confidential employee, which as explained above is alone insufficient to warrant political patronage dismissal. Aside from those arguments regarding factor three, the Defendants contend that the relationship between Vaughn and Walker “would be strained at best and could prevent…efficient performance of the duties of the office” and that Walker should be able to appoint a deputy in whom she trusts. Id. at p. 44. At the same time, this argument is undermined by the Defendants’ own contention that Vaughn was not terminated for her political activity. See Jordan, 516 F.3d at 299. Relevant to factor four (whether the employee’s activity may be characterized as hostile, abusive, or insubordinate), the Defendants point to the email from Farmer to Morgan regarding complaints that Vaughn was campaigning in the office, which the Court has noted above as lacking in sufficient factual detail. Other than that, as to factors four and five, the Defendants discuss other actions allegedly taken by Vaughn which appear unrelated to her political activity.16 In sum, the Defendants do not point to any facts which would 16 Specifically, the County contends that Vaughn shredded large amounts of public documents prior to Walker’s first day in office but provides no context as to what those documents consisted of and why that support an actual or potential disruption of the tax office due to Vaughn’s political activity. See Vojvodich, 48 F.3d at 885-86 (holding that “there simply is no countervailing state interest to weigh against the employee’s First Amendment rights” where sheriff did not allege that the employee’s political activity “actually or potentially affected the Sheriff’s Office’s ability to provide services[.]”); see also Jordan, 516 F.3d at 299. The Court finds that this inquiry requires further development of the facts. As noted, Vaughn has plausibly alleged a prima facie claim of First Amendment political retaliation. For the reasons explained above, the Court does not find that the Defendants have, at this stage of the proceedings, met their burden of proving that Vaughn was subject to political patronage dismissal under the Elrod-Branti exception. 2. Equal Protection Claim Next, the Court turns to Vaughn’s Equal Protection claim brought against all Defendants. Vaughn alleges that she was terminated from her employment due to her race (White). As to this claim, Walker did not join in the County’s arguments for its dismissal and therefore has not requested dismissal of this claim as against her.17 Thus, the Court will only reference the County and Farmer’s arguments. The County and Farmer take a similar position as to this claim. They rely on Crain v. City of Selma, 952 F.3d 634 (5th Cir. 2020) to support their argument that the claim fails because Vaughn has not identified a similarly situated comparator. In Crain, the Fifth Circuit explained alleged act could be considered hostile behavior. The County does not in any way link that alleged act with Vaughn’s political activity in campaigning for Montgomery. It also references Vaughn working on “the previous administration’s books during work hours[,]” yet it does not allege that Montgomery, Walker’s political opponent, was part of the previous administration. [51] at p. 45. To the contrary, the County identifies Allen Morgan as the former Tax Assessor/Collector prior to Walker. Again, the County makes no connection between these allegations and Vaughn’s political activity in support of Montgomery. 17 The Court reiterates that Walker has not sought dismissal based on qualified immunity at this time. that “[t]o state a claim of racial discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause and [S]ection 1983, the plaintiff must allege and prove that he received treatment different from that received by similarly situated individuals and that the unequal treatment stemmed from a discriminatory intent.” Id. at 642. However, Crain was not an employment discrimination case and for that reason the applicable law in this case differs. See id. at 638 (“Crain… argu[ed] that defendants discriminated against him on the basis of race when they denied him access to the ballot.”). In the context of Equal Protection claims for intentional discrimination in employment, the Fifth Circuit applies the same factors required to establish a prima facie case for race discrimination under Title VII and Section 1981. See Hopkins v. Wayside Sch., 2024 WL 3738478, at *12 (5th Cir. Aug. 9, 2024) (“[O]ur inquiry into intentional discrimination in employment is essentially the same for individual actions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1981, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment…, and Title VII[.]”); Boutwell v. Singing River Hosp. Sys., 2006 WL 21558, at *4 (S.D. Miss. Jan. 4, 2006) (“When [S]ection 1983 is used as a parallel remedy to transgressions under Title VII, however, the elements do not differ.”); Monteverde v. New Orleans Fire Dep’t, 124 F. App’x 900, 904 (5th Cir. 2005). To establish a prima facie case of race discrimination, Vaughn must show that she “(1) is a member of a protected class, (2) was qualified for the position that she held, (3) was subject to an adverse employment action, and (4) was replaced by someone outside of her protected class or treated less favorably than other similarly situated employees who were not in her protected class.” Harville v. City of Houston, Mississippi, 945 F.3d 870, 875 (5th Cir. 2019) (citing Alkhawaldeh v. Dow Chemical Co., 851 F.3d 422, 426 (5th Cir. 2017)). There is no dispute that the First Amended Complaint [14] alleges facts to support all elements of a prima facie case of race discrimination, including that Vaughn was replaced by a Black person. Absent further argument on the part of the County as to this claim, the Court finds that Vaughn has adequately pled a constitutional violation as to the County.18 The Court turns to Farmer. She generally argues in her Memorandum [51] that “[b]ecause there is no statutory authority, allegations in Vaughn’s Complaint, or evidence in the record that Defendant Farmer was involved or actually terminated Vaughn, all of her claims fail and Defendant Farmer is entitled to qualified immunity.” [53] at p. 15 (emphasis in original). Though Farmer appears to raise this argument in asserting her qualified immunity defense, the Court will consider it in relation to the existence of a potential constitutional violation since she generally contends that “all” of Vaughn’s federal claims fail on that basis. Id. Again, Vaughn’s termination is the crux of her Equal Protection claim. The First Amended Complaint [14] does not allege that Farmer was personally involved in the decision to terminate Vaughn and therefore no constitutional violation is pled against Farmer. See Sanchez v. Griffis, 569 F. Supp. 3d 496, 516 (W.D. Tex. 2021) (explaining that “[t]here must be some showing of personal involvement by a particular individual defendant to prevail against that individual” on a Section 1983 claim) (citing Champagne v. Jefferson Par. Sheriff’s Off., 188 F.3d 312, 314 (5th Cir. 1999)). Resultantly, the Court’s inquiry into her individual liability under Section 1983 ends here. See Lytle v. Bexar Cnty., Tex., 560 F.3d 404, 410 (5th Cir. 2009) (“If we determine that the alleged conduct did not violate a constitutional 18 The Court does not extensively address this claim as against the County because it raises no arguments as to the applicable elements of Vaughn’s discrimination claim brought pursuant to Section 1983. Since the same standard applies to this claim and Vaughn’s discrimination claims pursuant to Title VII and Section 1981, the Court has also looked to the County’s arguments regarding the prima facie elements of those claims. However, the County does not contest that Vaughn has pled a prima facie claim of discrimination in seeking dismissal of those claims. For example, with respect to Vaughn’s Title VII claim, the County argues that “[i]f this Court finds… that [Vaughn] has set forth a prima facie case, [the County] had legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for her termination.” [51] at p. 21. The County does not, however, analyze the prima facie elements under Title VII much less raise any argument that the elements are not adequately pled. See id. The County raises other arguments regarding Vaughn’s Title VII claim, such as alleging that it is not Vaughn’s Title VII employer, but those arguments are not relevant in this context. The County does not address the correct elements in seeking dismissal of the Section 1981 claim. See [51] at p. 24. right, our inquiry ceases because there is no constitutional violation for which the government official would need qualified immunity.”). Having concluded that the First Amended Complaint [14] fails to allege that Farmer was personally involved in the decision to terminate Vaughn, the Court need not analyze qualified immunity because there is no constitutional violation pled against her as required by the first prong of Section 1983. The Court now turns to the defense advanced by the County with respect to Vaughn’s claims brought pursuant to Section 1983. B. Municipal Liability Having concluded that Vaughn has plausibly alleged First Amendment retaliation and Equal Protection claims, the Court turns to whether Vaughn has adequately alleged facts to establish municipal liability pursuant to Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978). It is well-established that municipal liability under Section 1983 “may not be found on a theory of respondeat superior, but instead must be premised upon ‘some official action or imprimatur.’” Smith v. City of Madison, Miss., 364 F. Supp. 3d 656, 664 (S.D. Miss. Oct. 23, 2018) (quoting Valle, 613 F.3d at 541) (in turn quoting Piotrowski v. City of Houston, 237 F.3d 567, 578 (5th Cir. 2001)). For municipal liability to attach, there must be “a policymaker; an official policy; and a violation of constitutional rights whose ‘moving force’ is the policy or custom.” Piotrowski, 237 F.3d at 578 (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 694, 98 S. Ct. 2018). “The ‘plaintiff must show that the municipal action was taken with the requisite degree of culpability and must demonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.’” Vess v. City of Dallas, 608 F. Supp. 3d 434, 447 (N.D. Tex. 2022) (quoting Valle, 613 F.3d at 542). “[A] single decision by a policy maker may, under certain circumstances, constitute a policy for which the [municipality] may be liable.” Brown v. Bryan Cnty., OK, 219 F.3d 450, 462 (5th Cir. 2000). “A single decision, such as the decision to terminate a municipal employee, may therefore create municipal liability only where the decision is made by a final policymaker or the improper motive can be imputed to the final policymaker.” Smith, 364 F. Supp. 3d at 664 (citing Bolton v. City of Dallas, 541 F.3d 545, 548 (5th Cir. 2008); Woodard v. Andrus, 419 F.3d 348, 352 (5th Cir. 2005); Beattie v. Madison Cnty. Sch. Dist., 254 F.3d 595, 603 (5th Cir. 2001)). The County concedes (for purposes of its instant Motion [49] only) that Walker “could be considered a final policymaker with regard to employment decisions within her office.” [51] at p. 50. In her Response Memorandum [81], Vaughn relies on the “single decision by a final policymaker” theory of liability.19 The parties do not dispute that Walker made the decision to terminate Vaughn. The County correctly points out that the single decision exception “‘requires the deliberate choice to follow a course of action… made from among various alternatives by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in question.’” Degollado v. City of Port Lavaca, Texas, 2025 WL 976603, at *12 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 31, 2025) (quoting Webb v. Town of Saint Joseph, 925 F.3d 209, 215 (5th Cir. 2019)) (emphasis in original). In its Memorandum [51], the County argues that Vaughn fails to allege in her First Amended Complaint [14] that Walker was deliberately indifferent to her constitutional rights when Walker decided to terminate her. Relatedly, the County argues that Vaughn does not allege that Walker 19 Vaughn additionally argues that Farmer and the County are final policymakers. In light of the County’s concession that Walker could be considered a final policymaker, the Court need not address those arguments. “considered numerous alternatives and then chose to act in a manner violating her constitutional rights.” [51] at p. 51. Though neither party acknowledges it, courts within the Fifth Circuit recognize that “where a plaintiff claims that a particular municipal action itself violates federal law, or directs an employee to do so, resolving… issues of fault and causation is straight forward.” Arredondo v. Flores, 2006 WL 2459460, at *2 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 22, 2006) (quoting Bd. of the Cnty. Comm’rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1997)) (emphasis in original). “Proof that a municipality’s authorized decisionmaker ‘has intentionally deprived a plaintiff of a federally protected right necessarily establishes that the municipality acted culpably.’” Id. (quoting Brown, 520 U.S. at 404, 117 S. Ct. 1382). In Flores, the plaintiffs, former employees of the Webb County, Texas Sheriff’s Department, sued Rick Flores and Webb County alleging that Flores terminated them in retaliation for their support of Flores’ political opponent in his campaign for county sheriff. Id. at *1. In analyzing the issue of municipal liability at the motion to dismiss stage, the District Court for the Southern District of Texas determined that Flores was a final decisionmaker with respect to employment decisions in the sheriff’s department and that his decision to terminate the plaintiffs’ employment constituted an official policy of Webb County. Id. at *2. The court, relying on Brown, held that the plaintiffs had sufficiently stated a claim for municipal liability where they alleged that Flores had intentionally terminated their employment in retaliation of them having exercised their First Amendment rights. Id. Specifically, the court concluded that the plaintiffs’ claim “sufficiently allege[d] both culpability and causation—that is, it allege[d] a culpable motive, and allege[d] that Plaintiffs’ constitutional deprivations were the result of Defendant Flores’ actions as a final decisionmaker.” Id. In rejecting Webb County’s argument that the plaintiffs sought to impose vicarious liability against it, the court reiterated that “[p]laintiffs assert an official policy that was the proximate cause of their constitutional injury, not merely vicarious liability.” Id. at *3. Here, as in Flores, Vaughn alleges in her First Amended Complaint [14] that Walker acted intentionally and in bad faith in terminating her in retaliation for her exercise of First Amendment rights and for discriminatory reasons.20 All of Vaughn’s Section 1983 claims are based on Walker’s employment decision as a policymaker of the County. Accepting Vaughn’s allegations as true, she sufficiently alleges that Walker’s employment decision itself violated her constitutional rights. See Reyna v. Garza, 569 F. Supp. 3d 567, 584 (S.D. Tex. 2021) (quoting Brown, 520 U.S. at 405, 117 S. Ct. 1382) (“[T]he conclusion that the action taken or directed by the municipality or its authorized decisionmaker itself violates federal law will also determine that the municipal action was the moving force behind the injury of which the plaintiff complains.”). At this stage of the proceedings, the Court finds that Vaughn has plausibly stated a Monell claim against the County. See id. (holding that plaintiff’s allegations satisfied the culpability and causation elements of his Monell claim on the same basis). C. Remaining Federal Claims Vaughn also brings race discrimination claims pursuant to Section 1981 and Title VII against all Defendants. The Court will address these claims in turn. 1. Section 1981 The Defendants seek dismissal of Vaughn’s Section 1981 claim on its merits for varying reasons. The County argues that the claim fails because it is not Vaughn’s employer. Walker joins 20 The Court is cognizant that Vaughn raises this allegation in a section of her First Amended Complaint [14] concerning one of her state law claims but nonetheless finds the contention overarching and relevant here. in the County’s Motion [49] and supporting Memorandum [51] “in so much as it applies to [her], including but not limited to,” the County’s arguments concerning the nondiscriminatory reasons for Vaughn’s termination. [58] at p. 1. Farmer, for her part, argues that the claim should be dismissed because Vaughn does not identify a contract between her and Farmer, as well as for other reasons. The Court does not need to extensively address these arguments to find that Vaughn’s Section 1981 claim is subject to dismissal. First, Vaughn fails to respond to the County’s arguments regarding this claim in her Response Memorandum [81] and therefore has abandoned the claim as against the County. See McClelland v. Katy Indep. Sch. Dist., 63 F.4th 996, 1010 (5th Cir. 2023) (“[A] party abandons a claim by failing to defend it in response to motions to dismiss and other dispositive pleadings.”) (citations omitted). Since Walker joins, in part, in the County’s arguments, Vaughn’s claim could be deemed abandoned as to Walker as well. It is unnecessary for the Court to grapple with that dilemma because this claim fails for alternative reasons as to all Defendants. Assuming arguendo that the County is Vaughn’s employer, Vaughn’s claim fails because “[t]here is no private right of action under § 1981 against a public employer.” Claiborne v. Mississippi Bd. of Pharmacy, 2011 WL 3684431, at *4 (S.D. Miss. Aug. 22, 2011) (citing Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 735, 109 S. Ct. 2702, 105 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1989)); see also Oden v. Oktibbeha County, 246 F.3d 458, 463–64 (5th Cir. 2001). “To achieve redress for discrimination or retaliation claims against a public employer, a plaintiff must sue under [Section] 1983[.]” Id. (citing Oden, 246 F.3d at 463–64). Vaughn does so in this case. As such, her Section 1981 claim against the County is due to be dismissed. Further, Vaughn does not make clear her basis for imposing Section 1981 liability against Farmer and Walker in their individual capacities. In response to Farmer’s Motion [52], Vaughn argues that “Farmer and Walker are agents of Defendant County in dealing with Vaughn’s employment…” and that Farmer and Walker are “essentially one and the same.” [79] at p. 14. If that is the case, then the claim fails against Farmer and Walker by extension because it does so against the County for the reason explained above. It is also undisputed that Farmer is not Vaughn’s employer. And, as it pertains to Walker’s individual liability, it is well established that “[Section] 1981 does not impose ‘personal liability on elected officials for discrimination in the terms and conditions of local government employment contracts.’” Hill v. Brown, 2022 WL 3094329, at *6 (W.D. La. July 19, 2022) (quoting Oden, 246 F.3d at 464). Accordingly, this claim is also due to be dismissed against Farmer and Walker, individually. 2. Title VII Vaughn asserts a Title VII race discrimination claim against all Defendants. As an initial matter, Vaughn concedes that Farmer, individually, is not her employer under Title VII. This claim is therefore dismissed as to Farmer. With regard to the remaining defendants, the Court will first address the parties’ arguments relevant to the County and then turn to Walker’s position concerning this claim. The County disputes that it is Vaughn’s Title VII employer and primarily seeks dismissal of this claim on that basis. Additionally, it argues that Vaughn is not the type of employee that can avail herself of the protections of Title VII. The Court will address each of these arguments. i. Vaughn’s Employer under Title VII “Title VII allows employees to sue their employers for discriminatory employment decisions.” Oden, 246 F.3d at 465 (citing 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e–2(a), 2000e–5). “Determining whether a defendant is an ‘employer’ under Title VII involves a two-step process.” Muhammad v. Dallas Cnty. Cmty. Supervision & Corr. Dep’t, 479 F.3d 377, 380 (5th Cir. 2007). “First, the court must determine whether the defendant falls within Title VII’s statutory definition of an ‘employer.’” Id. Under Title VII, “[t]he term ‘employer’ means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees…, and any agent of such a person.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b). “A person ‘includes one or more individuals, governments, governmental agencies, or political subdivisions… .’” Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(a)). “If the defendant meets this definition, the court must then analyze whether an employment relationship exists between the plaintiff and the defendant.” Muhammad, 479 F.3d at 380. Relevant here, the County “does not dispute that it could be considered an employer under Title VII” but “does dispute that it is Vaughn’s employer under Title VII.” [51] at p. 10. Thus, the Court moves on to this second step of the inquiry.21 To determine whether an employment relationship exists within the meaning of Title VII, the Fifth Circuit applies the hybrid economic realities/common law control test. Id. “The most important component of this test is the right to control the employee’s conduct.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). “When examining the control component, we have focused on whether the alleged employer has the right to hire, fire, supervise, and set the work schedule of the employee.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In determining whether a person or entity is an employer under Title VII, federal law controls “but courts can look to state law to understand the nature of the employment relationship.” Oden, 246 F.3d at 465. “The economic realities component of the test focuses on ‘whether the alleged employer paid the 21 The Court acknowledges that in her Response Memorandum [81] Vaughn raises arguments concerning an alleged agency relationship between Walker and the County. However, because the County does not dispute that the first step is met, then it is unnecessary for the Court to determine whether or not Walker is the County’s agent. Vaughn does not bring her Title VII claim against Walker in her official capacity—she brings her claim against the County. If the County meets the definition—and here it concedes that it does— then “the court must then analyze whether an employment relationship exists between the plaintiff and the [County].” Muhammad, 479 F.3d at 380. The apparent agency issue is of no consequence to this inquiry. employee’s salary, withheld taxes, provided benefits, and set the terms and conditions of employment.’” Muhammad, 479 F.3d at 380 (quoting Deal v. State Farm Cnty. Mut. Ins. Co. of Texas, 5 F.3d 117, 119 (5th Cir. 1993)). The County argues that the Tax Assessor/Collector is the sole decisionmaker in the hiring and firing of employees of its office and the County’s Board of Supervisors has no authority in that regard. Similarly, it argues that only the Tax Assessor/Collector sets the work schedules of its deputies as well as their terms and conditions of employment. The County points to Mississippi statutory law to support its argument that no employment relationship exists between it and Vaughn. Concerning the control component, the County cites to Mississippi Code Section 27-1-9, which provides, in pertinent part, that “[e]ach assessor and tax collector shall appoint a sufficient number of deputies to assist him in carrying out the duties of his office and fix their compensation, subject to the budget for the assessor and tax collector’s office approved by the county board of supervisors.” MISS. CODE ANN. § 27-1-9(a). It also relies on advisory opinions rendered by the Mississippi Attorney General which provide some guidance regarding Mississippi Tax Assessor/Collectors’ authority to make employment decisions contrasted from that of a county’s Board of Supervisors. See 2001 WL 1513771, at *1 (Miss. A.G. Oct. 5, 2001) (finding no authority for the board of supervisors to appoint deputy tax assessors and stating that, pursuant to Sections 27-1-3 and 27-1-9 of the Mississippi Code, “the tax assessor-collector has the authority to hire and fire employees of the tax assessor’s office and that the Board of Supervisors is without the authority to reinstate an employee that has been terminated from the Tax Assessor’s office.”). As for the economic realities portion of the test, the County “does not dispute that employees in the Tax Assessor’s Office receive their paychecks from Oktibbeha County and that the County offers retirement and other benefits to the employees.” [51] at p. 17. However, it again asserts that Mississippi Code Section 27-1-9 specifies that Tax Assessors/Collectors are to submit a budget, which includes the compensation amount for deputy clerks, to the Board of Supervisors for approval. Therefore, according to the County, employee salaries are determined solely by the Tax Assessor/Collector. In her Response Memorandum [81], Vaughn does not specifically address the Mississippi statutes cited by the County, but she does argue that “the attorney general opinions are relevant only to the extent that they define the structures of hiring and firing authority within the tax assessor’s office.” [81] at p. 8.22 Vaughn further argues that there is “no legally distinct entity” other than the County that could be Vaughn’s Title VII employer. The Court finds instructive the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Muhammad, 479 F.3d at 377. In Muhammad, the plaintiff, a former probation officer in Dallas County, Texas, sued the Dallas County Community Supervision and Corrections Department for race discrimination and retaliation under Title VII. Id. at 378. The defendant sought dismissal of the claims under Rule 12 alleging that, as a matter of law, it was not the plaintiff’s Title VII employer. Id. at 379. In deciding whether defendant was plaintiff’s employer for purposes of Title VII, the district court, relying on Clark v. Tarrant Cnty., Texas, 798 F.2d 736 (5th Cir. 1986), “refrained from invoking the hybrid economic realities/common law control test or resorting to Texas state law because it concluded that federal law (i.e., Clark) decided the issue” under near identical circumstances. Id. at 381. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit rejected the district court’s interpretation of Clark stating: 22 Vaughn appears to raise this argument in response to the County’s contention that Vaughn is excepted from Title VII’s definition of employees covered under the Act. Because the County relies on the same statutory authorities and attorney general opinions to support both of the arguments advanced in its Memorandum [51], the Court acknowledges Vaughn’s response concerning those authorities in this subsection. Clark does not stand for the proposition that a community supervision and corrections department is, as a matter of law, not a probation officer’s Title VII employer… Rather, Clark simply holds that county is not a probation officer’s Title VII employer when “the evidence before the court and Texas case law clearly demonstrate that the County has no authority to set salaries or to decide promotion of adult probation officers, and there is no contrary evidence.” Id. (quoting Clark, 798 F.2d at 747-48) (emphasis added). In reversing the district court’s holding that defendant was not plaintiff’s Title VII employer, the Fifth Circuit explained that “[t]he hybrid economic realities/common law control test is necessarily a fact-specific inquiry and is therefore typically applied in a summary judgment context, in which a court is permitted to go beyond the pleadings and examine the state law and the evidence relevant to the employment relationship.” Id. at 382 (emphasis added). The district court was directed to make further factual findings about the nature and circumstances of plaintiff’s position. Id. at 383. As Muhammad makes clear, not only is state law relevant for the Court to determine whether an employment relationship exists between Vaughn and the County, but the Court must also consider the facts relevant to Vaughn’s position as a bookkeeper/deputy clerk as established in the record. Aside from relying on Mississippi statutory law and opinions of the Mississippi Attorney General, the County relies on scant evidence to support its position that the County is not Vaughn’s Title VII employer. The County only points to an email from the former tax assessor/collector to the County Administrator expressing that the deputies in the tax office are his employees; however, the context of the email surrounds a dispute on how the County Administrator handled a complaint she allegedly received. The email sheds no light on the County’s right (or lack thereof) to make employment decisions over Vaughn. Aside from this evidence, the County points to a memo addressed to the “payroll department” approving a payroll change based on Vaughn’s discharge and blank payroll sheets. Without more, the Court lacks sufficient context to make any inferences based on those documents. Accordingly, the Court declines to consider the evidence submitted by the County. The County additionally argues that the Fifth Circuit’s 2001 decision in Oden v. Oktibbeha Cnty., Miss. is “controlling authority [which] has found that a county-elected official is the proper employer under Title VII, rather than the County itself.” [87] at p. 12. In that case, the Fifth Circuit reversed a district court’s judgment against Oktibbeha County upon determining that the sheriff, in his official capacity, was the plaintiff’s Title VII employer. Oden, 246 F.3d at 465. The Fifth Circuit considered Mississippi statutory law in making its determination. Id. The County argues that the “reasoning and facts relied upon in Oden… are almost identical to the facts in the case at bar.” [87] at p. 12. The Court disagrees. The only comparable aspect of Oden and the case sub judice lies in that the language of the Mississippi statutes considered in that case are similar to the Mississippi statutory law on which the County now relies. However, as the Fifth Circuit explained in Muhammad, the Court cannot rely on state law alone in determining whether an employment relationship exists. To the extent the County is asking for this Court to find as a matter of law, pursuant to Oden, that the County is not Vaughn’s employer, Muhammad forecloses that too. See Muhammad 479 F.3d at 383 (reversing the district court’s holding after it solely relied on federal case law without considering state law and factual evidence to determine whether defendant was plaintiff’s employer under Title VII). As with other claims, this inquiry will require further development of the facts. ii. Personal Staff Exception Next, the County argues that Vaughn’s Title VII claim fails because she is not a covered employee under Title VII. “Title VII limits the class of employees who can take advantage of its provisions.” Saddler v. Quitman Cnty. Sch. Dist., 278 F. App’x 412, 416 (5th Cir. 2008). The definition of employee under Title VII excludes “‘any person elected to public office in any State or political subdivision of any State by the qualified voters thereof, or any person chosen by such officer to be on such officer’s personal staff… .’” Id. at 416-17 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f)). Prior to addressing the parties’ arguments on the applicability of this exception, the Court will address Vaughn’s argument that the County has waived this exception in failing to raise it as an affirmative defense in its Answer [27]. See Oden, 246 F.3d at 465 (“The personal staff exception is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded under Rule 8(c).”). A defendant is required to state affirmative defenses in its responsive pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 and “[f]ailure to comply with this rule may result in waiver.” Motion Med. Techs., L.L.C. v. Thermotek, Inc., 875 F.3d 765, 771 (5th Cir. 2017). “Affirmative defenses must be pled ‘with enough specificity or factual particularity to give the plaintiff fair notice of the defense that is being advanced.’” Green Hills Dev. Co., LLC v. Oppenheimer Funds, Inc., 2022 WL 370235, at *1 (S.D. Miss. Feb. 7, 2022) (quoting Woodfield v. Bowman, 193 F.3d 354, 362 (5th Cir. 1999)). The County argues that it has not waived the affirmative defense of the personal staff exception and directs the Court to the “First Affirmative Defense” in its Answer [27]. Specifically, the County argues that because its “First Affirmative Defense” states that Vaughn “was an employee of a county-wide elected official” it has sufficiently stated the defense in its responsive pleading. [87] at p. 10. Notably, the County makes this allegation under its “First Affirmative Defense” which is followed by a subheading labeled “(§1983 Claim).” [27] at p. 1. The affirmative defense does not mention Title VII. In the Court’s view, this single statement asserted under a Section 1983 subheading lacks sufficient specificity to place Vaughn on notice that the personal staff exception is being raised as an affirmative defense to her Title VII claim. The defense could be considered waived. Nonetheless, the Fifth Circuit has held that “if the affirmative defense is raised in the trial court in a manner that does not result in unfair surprise, then a technical failure to comply precisely with Rule 8(c) is not fatal.” Thermotek, Inc., 875 F.3d at 771 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). A defendant avoids waiver of an affirmative defense if “(1) the defendant raised the affirmative defense at a pragmatically sufficient time and (2) the plaintiff was not prejudiced in its ability to respond.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Here, Vaughn does not argue that she has suffered any prejudice in her ability to respond to this defense because it was not specifically stated in the County’s Answer [27]. The Court finds, based on Fifth Circuit precedent, that the County raised this defense at a “pragmatically sufficient time.” See Thermotek, Inc., 875 F.3d at 771 (“We have repeatedly rejected waiver arguments when a defendant raised an affirmative defense for the first time at summary judgment—or even later.”). Vaughn provides no argument to support a contrary finding. The Court rejects her waiver argument. Turning to the parties’ arguments regarding whether this exception applies to Vaughn, it is undisputed that the Tax Assessor/Collector is a person elected to public office and that Vaughn worked as a bookkeeper/deputy clerk in the Tax Assessor/Collector’s office. Notably, “Title VII does not define ‘personal staff.’” Saddler, 278 F. App’x at 417. The Fifth Circuit considers a nonexhaustive list of factors to determine whether a plaintiff qualifies as “personal staff’” of a public official: (1) whether the elected official has plenary powers of appointment and removal, (2) whether the person in the position at issue is personally accountable to only that elected official, (3) whether the person in the position at issue represents the elected official in the eyes of the public, (4) whether the elected official exercises a considerable amount of control over the position, (5) the level of the position within the organization’s chain of command, and (6) the actual intimacy of the working relationship between the elected official and the person filling the position. Id. (citing Teneyuca v. Bexar County, 767 F.2d 148, 151 (5th Cir.1985)). The Fifth Circuit has cautioned that “consideration of these factors must be tempered by the legislative history of this provision which indicates that the exception is to be narrowly construed.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Similar to an employer status under Title VII, “‘a plaintiff’s status as an employee under Title VII is a question of federal, rather than of state, law.’” Muhammad 479 F.3d at 382 (quoting Calderon v. Martin Cnty., 639 F.2d 271, 272-73 (5th Cir. 1981)). In analyzing the above factors, the County relies on the same Mississippi statutory law and Attorney General opinions as it did to support its argument that it is not Vaughn’s Title VII employer. The County also relies on much of the same evidence, which the Court has already explained lacks necessary context and detail. The Court declines to consider that evidence for the same reason it did above. The Fifth Circuit has described consideration of the above factors as “a fact-intensive inquiry” that “does not lend itself well to disposition by summary judgment, though [it] is not a categorical prohibition.” Saddler, 278 F. App’x at 417 (quoting Teneyuca, 767 F.2d at 151) (internal quotation marks omitted). Vaughn argues that, at this stage of the proceedings, the Court is without sufficient evidence to properly analyze the above factors. The Court agrees— particularly in light of its finding that the evidence the County has presented at this juncture does not aid the Court in reaching a conclusive decision. Further development of the facts is necessary for the Court to conduct this “fact-intensive inquiry.” Id.23 23 The County alternatively argues that it has provided a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Vaughn’s termination and that Vaughn has failed to show pretext under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Since the Court has declined to convert the pending Motions [49, 52] for judgment on the pleadings to motions for summary judgment, it is not proper for the Court to conduct an analysis under iii. Walker—Individually The Court will now address Walker’s position as to this claim. With respect to Walker’s individual liability, the Court again notes that Walker joins in the County’s Motion [49] and supporting Memorandum [51] “in so much as it applies to [her], including but not limited to,” the County’s arguments concerning the nondiscriminatory reasons for Vaughn’s termination. [58] at p. 1. However, Walker does not otherwise seek dismissal of Vaughn’s Title VII claim on the basis that she, in her individual capacity, is not Vaughn’s employer. Notwithstanding her omission, Title VII does not provide for individual liability against Walker. See Bailey v. Dallas Cnty. Sch., 2016 WL 7638146, at *5 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 9, 2016) (“Any Title VII claims against [defendants] in their individual capacities are not cognizable under Fifth Circuit law.”) (citing Smith v. Amedisys, Inc., 298 F.3d 434, 448 (5th Cir. 2002)); see also Ackel v. Nat’l Commc’ns, Inc., 339 F.3d 376, 382 n.1 (5th Cir.2003) (“Individuals are not liable under Title VII in either their individual or official capacities.”). Because Vaughn’s Title VII claim against Walker in her individual capacity is foreclosed by law, the Court is, on its own initiative, considering dismissing the claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f)(1). Vaughn is hereby directed to show cause as to why this claim should not be dismissed and is directed to file a response in this regard within 14 days from the date of this Order. If she fails to do so, the Court will dismiss the Title VII claim against Walker. Having addressed Vaughn’s federal claims, the Court turns to her state law claims. McDonnell Douglas at this stage of the proceedings. See Johnson v. Halstead, 916 F.3d 410, 421 n.4 (5th Cir. 2019) (“[T]he McDonell Douglas framework used for evaluating circumstantial evidence at summary judgment does not apply at the pleading stage.”) (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002)). D. State Law Claims Vaughn asserts three state law claims including wrongful discharge in violation of public policy against the County, violation of Mississippi’s Whistleblower Protection Act against all Defendants, and tortious interference with employment against Farmer and Walker. 1. Wrongful Discharge (McArn claim) In Mississippi, a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy is recognized as an independent tort claim. See Cmty. Care Ctr. of Aberdeen v. Barrentine, 160 So. 3d 216, 218 (Miss. 2015) (citing McArn v. Allied Bruce-Terminix Co., 626 So. 2d 603, 607 (Miss. 1993)). Again, Vaughn brings this claim against the County only. The County argues that this claim should be dismissed for procedural and substantive reasons. First, the County contends that Vaughn failed to appeal the Board of Supervisor’s approval of the payroll change for Vaughn due to her termination (an avenue available under Mississippi statutory law). The County further argues that, because Vaughn did not appeal the payroll change approval, she in turn failed to exhaust all administrative remedies under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (“MTCA”). This argument is easily rejected. The County points to Mississippi statutory law providing that “[a]ny person aggrieved by a judgment or decision of the board of supervisors of a county, or the governing authority of a municipality, may appeal the judgment or decision to the circuit court of the county in which the board… is located.” MISS. CODE ANN. § 11-51-75. To be clear, Vaughn’s McArn claim is based on the premise that she was terminated for reporting Walker to the State Auditor’s office. See [14] at p. 5. In her Response Memorandum [81], Vaughn argues that her grievance lies in the termination decision. The Court agrees and finds the County’s argument misplaced. Unless the County now changes its litigation stance to concede that Vaughn’s termination was the decision, or partially the decision, of the Board of Supervisors, Mississippi Code Section 11-51-75 is inapplicable here. The County does not contend that its approval of the payroll change for Vaughn finalized Vaughn’s termination or that the approval formed part of the decision to terminate Vaughn. In fact, the County has profusely argued that the Tax Assessor/Collector has the sole authority to hire and fire deputy clerks in the tax office. A central issue in this case is whether the County made any employment decisions pertaining to Vaughn. There is no requirement for Vaughn to appeal a decision by which she is not aggrieved—unless it was part of the termination decision. The County does not direct the Court to any other procedure which Vaughn did not follow under the MTCA. Having resolved that procedural issue, the Court turns to the parties’ arguments on the merits of this claim. “A McArn claim alleging wrongful discharge in violation of public policy is based on an employer’s duty not to thwart the public interest by terminating employees for speaking the truth.” Barrentine, 160 So. 3d at 220. In order to state a McArn claim, a plaintiff must allege that “(1) plaintiff was an employee of the defendant, (2) an illegal act by the employer, [and] (3) plaintiff was terminated because they reported the illegal act of the employer.” Brandi’s Hope Cmty. Servs., LLC v. Walters, 391 So. 3d 162, 170 (Miss. 2024). The County contests the first and third elements of this claim. As to the first element, the County argues that Vaughn was not its employee. It incorporates all arguments it raised in relation to Vaughn’s Title VII claim. See [51] at p. 56. (“Vaughn is not [the County’s] employee for all the reasons set forth in Section IV.A.1.i above… .”). Importantly, the County’s arguments concerning the Title VII claim address definitions and standards for “employer” and “employee” status that are specific to Title VII claims. The County does not provide the Court with any authority which indicates that those same definitions apply to Vaughn’s McArn claim. The Court finds that the County has not adequately briefed its argument. See McMahan v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n, 2024 WL 2243301, at *17 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 11, 2024) (explaining that an argument that is not sufficiently briefed is waived). The First Amended Complaint [14] alleges that Vaughn was employed with the County. See [14] at p. 3. She has sufficiently pled the first element of this claim. Regarding the third element, the County argues that Vaughn was terminated due to insubordination and not because she reported Walker’s alleged illegal activity to the State Auditor. It does not contest that the First Amended Complaint [14] alleges that Vaughn was terminated because of her report. The Court declines to dismiss this claim. 2. Whistleblower Claim Vaughn asserts a claim against all Defendants for violation of the Mississippi Whistleblower Protection Act (“MWPA”). Walker does not seek dismissal of this claim and therefore the claim will proceed as against her. The Court will address Farmer and the County’s respective positions in seeking dismissal of this claim. The MWPA is “codified at Mississippi Code Sections 25-9-171 to -177” and “prohibits a governmental employer from taking any ‘reprisal or retaliatory action’ against a governmental employee (whistleblower) ‘who in good faith reports an alleged improper governmental action to a state investigative body, initiating an investigation.’” Johnson v. Miller, 396 So. 3d 1137, 1140 (Miss. 2024) (quoting MISS. CODE ANN. § 25-9-171(j)). As previously noted, Vaughn concedes that Farmer is not her employer. This claim is therefore dismissed as against Farmer, individually.24 24 Additionally, the MWPA provides that “[n]o agency shall dismiss or otherwise adversely affect the compensation or employment status of any public employee because the public employee testified or For its part, the County argues that Vaughn does not meet the definition of a “whistleblower” under the MWPA and that her termination was not a direct result of her report to the State Auditor. Regarding the County’s first argument, the MWPA defines a “whistleblower” as: [A]n employee who in good faith reports an alleged improper governmental action to a state investigative body, initiating an investigation. For purposes of the provisions of Section 25-9-171 through 25-9-177, the term “whistleblower” also means an employee who in good faith provides information to a state investigative body, or an employee who is believed to have reported alleged improper governmental action to a state investigative body or to have provided information to a state investigative body but who, in fact, has not reported such action or provided such information. MISS. CODE ANN. § 25-9-171(j). The County places emphasis on the apparent “good faith” requirement. It argues that Vaughn did not file her report to the State Auditor in good faith because “her report was motivated solely out of spite because her preferred candidate in the election lost to the very person she reported and out of concern for her job.” [51] at p. 57. In response, Vaughn argues that “[w]hether Vaughn acted in good faith depends upon whether she had a factual basis for her claim.” [81] at p. 19. The MWPA does not define “good faith” and the Court is unaware of any Mississippi law defining this term of art in this context. The Court will interpret the meaning of “good faith” using provided information to a state investigative body whether or not the testimony or information is provided under oath.” MISS. CODE ANN. § 25-9-173(1) (emphasis added). To state the obvious, Farmer, in her individual capacity, is not an agency. The only statutory provision concerning individuals states that “each member of any agency’s governing board or authority may be found individually liable for a civil fine of up to Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) for each violation of Section 25-9-173.” Id. § 25-9-175 (emphasis added). The MWPA does not provide for individual liability otherwise. the same method of statutory interpretation used by the Mississippi Supreme Court. See Camacho v. Ford Motor Co., 993 F.3d 308, 311 (5th Cir. 2021). The Mississippi Supreme Court has relatively recently held that “all words and phrases contained in the statutes are used according to their common and ordinary meaning[.]” Watson v. Oppenheim, 301 So. 3d 37, 42 (Miss. 2020) (internal quotations and citations omitted). “When a popular word is used that contains no statutory definition, it must be accepted in its popular sense.” Id. (citing Lambert v. Ogden, 423 So. 2d 1319, 1321 (Miss. 1982)). “Absent a statutory definition of a term, our courts may properly consider dictionary definitions ‘to ascertain the meaning of a word in its common or popular sense.’” Id. (quoting Lawson v. Honeywell Int’l, Inc., 75 So. 3d 1024, 1028 (Miss. 2011)). The Court accordingly considers the dictionary definition of “good faith.” Black’s Law Dictionary defines “good faith” as: A state of mind consisting in (1) honesty in belief or purpose, (2) faithfulness to one’s duty or obligation, (3) observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in a given trade or business, or absence of intent to defraud or to seek unconscionable advantage. Good Faith, Black’s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024). Additionally, for context, the Court notes that the MWPA provides that “[a] governmental entity is not precluded from taking any action in accordance with established personnel policies against an employee who knowingly and intentionally provides false information to a state investigative body.” MISS. CODE ANN. § 25-9-173(5) (emphasis added). Considering this provision in conjunction with the dictionary definition cited above, the County’s argument fails. The County does not argue that Vaughn provided false information pertaining to Walker’s alleged illegal activity to the State Auditor. It also does not provide the Court with conclusive evidence that provides any insight into Vaughn’s state of mind in making the report, much less that she did so with a dishonest or fraudulent purpose. The County also incorporates its arguments made in relation to one of Vaughn’s First Amendment retaliation claims, including its position that Vaughn did not speak on a matter of public concern because her report was personally motivated. See [51] at p. 57 (incorporating arguments raised in “Section IV.A.3.i.a” of the County’s Memorandum [51]). Candidly, those incorporated arguments are not relevant to the applicable state law at issue here, and the Court finds that the County failed to adequately brief its argument. See McMahan, 2024 WL 2243301 at *17. The First Amended Complaint [14] alleges that Vaughn made her report to the State Auditor “as soon as she learned that it had occurred” and that she produced accurate records “documenting the theft.” [14] at p. 4. Vaughn sufficiently alleges that she acted in good faith in making her report. Finally, the County also contends that Vaughn has not alleged that her termination was a direct result of her report to the State Auditor because she alleges other reasons for her discharge. The MWPA provides that a whistleblower employee may not recover damages under the Act “unless the dismissal or adverse action taken against him was the direct result of providing information to a state investigative body.” MISS. CODE ANN. § 25-9-173(3). As the Court has already concluded, Vaughn sufficiently pleads that she was terminated because she filed the report. This argument is rejected. For the reasons stated above, Vaughn may proceed on this claim against the County and Walker. 3. Tortious Interference With Employment Lastly, the Court turns to Vaughn’s tortious interference with employment claim against Farmer and Walker. As with Vaughn’s whistleblower claim, Walker does not seek dismissal of this claim and therefore the claim will proceed as against her. “Tortious interference with an at-will employment relationship can form the basis of a claim under Mississippi law, and the elements of tortious interference with employment are the same as those for tortious interference with contract.” Joseph v. City of Moss Point, Mississippi, 2021 WL 6752167, at *5 (S.D. Miss. Feb. 26, 2021) (citing Levens v. Campbell, 733 So. 2d 753, 760 (Miss. 1999); McClinton v. Delta Pride Catfish, Inc., 792 So. 2d 968, 976 (Miss. 2001)). The elements of a claim for tortious interference with contract are: (1) defendant acted intentionally and willfully; (2) defendant’s actions were calculated to cause damage to the plaintiff in her lawful business; (3) defendant’s actions “were done with an unlawful purpose [of] causing damage and loss, without right or justifiable cause on the part of defendant (which constitutes malice);” and (4) actual damage and loss resulted. Id. (quoting Hollywood Cemetery Ass’n v. Bd. of Mayor & Selectmen of City of McComb City, 760 So. 2d 715, 719 (Miss. 2000)); Springer v. Ausbern Const. Co., 231 So. 3d 1065, 1068 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016). As with other claims asserted against Farmer, the Court’s finding that the First Amended Complaint [14] fails to allege any personal involvement on her part in the decision to terminate Vaughn warrants the dismissal of this claim. Vaughn argues that “[a] jury may reasonably infer that [Farmer] had the ability to influence [Walker].” [79] at p. 19. As Mississippi law makes clear, there must be a causal connection between Farmer’s alleged actions and Vaughn’s resulted loss. The First Amended Complaint [14] is void of any facts from which the Court could reasonably infer that Farmer exerted influence over Walker or that she otherwise caused Vaughn to be terminated. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937. The Court therefore rejects Vaughn’s argument. This claim is dismissed as against Farmer. Conclusion25 For the reasons set forth above, the County and Farmer’s respective Motions for Judgment on the Pleadings, or Alternatively, for Summary Judgment [49, 52] are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. All of Vaughn’s claims against Farmer, individually, are hereby DISMISSED. The Clerk of Court is hereby directed to terminate Farmer as an active defendant in this case. Vaughn’s Section 1981 claim against all Defendants is DISMISSED. Vaughn is hereby directed to show cause as to why her Title VII claim against Walker, in her individual capacity, should not be dismissed and is directed to file a response in this regard within 14 days from the date of this Order. Should Vaughn fail to do so, the Court will dismiss the claim as against Walker without further notice. Vaughn may proceed on the following claims: 1. First Amendment retaliation based on her report to the State Auditor brought under Section 1983 against the County; 2. First Amendment retaliation based on her political activity brought under Section 1983 against the County and Walker; 3. Equal Protection (race discrimination) brought under Section 1983 against the County and Walker; 4. Title VII (race discrimination) against the County; 5. Wrongful discharge in violation of public policy (McArn) against the County; 25 To the extent the Court has not specifically addressed the parties’ remaining arguments, it has considered them and determined that they would not alter the result. 6. Violation of Mississippi’s Whistleblower Protection Act against the County and Walker; and 7. Tortious interference with employment against Walker. The previously-imposed stay is hereby LIFTED. The Magistrate Judge will hold a status conference in due course. SO ORDERED, this the 19th day of September, 2025. /s/ Sharion Aycock SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE', '_score': 0.19595041871070862}]\n"
